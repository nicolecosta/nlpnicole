{"title": "World Bank Group - International Development, Poverty, & Sustainability", "content": "With 189 member countries, staff from more than 170 countries, and offices in over 130 locations, the World Bank Group is a unique global partnership: five institutions working for sustainable solutions that reduce poverty and build shared prosperity in developing countries. \u00a0 The World Bank Group works in every major area of development. \u00a0We provide a wide array of financial products and technical assistance, and we help countries share and apply innovative knowledge and solutions to the challenges they face. We face big challenges to help the world\u2019s poorest people and ensure that everyone sees benefits from economic growth. Data and research help us understand these challenges and set priorities, share knowledge of what works, and measure progress. As the world\u2019s largest multilateral source of financing for water in developing countries, the World Bank Group is committed to innovative, inclusive, and sustainable water action as we work together with our partners towards a water-secure world. In his speech,\u00a0\u201cGrowth and Stability During Crises,\u201d\u00a0World Bank Group President David Malpass\u00a0will discuss the challenges facing development policy, including the need for macroeconomic stability, the importance of private capital to international integration, and the increasing need to support global public goods. The live-streamed speech, taking place Thursday, March 30th at 9:30am EDT, will be hosted by the Abdou Moumouni\u00a0University of Niamey, Niger. Our latest update from March 23 shows that domestic food price inflation remains high in almost all low-, middle-, and high-income countries.\u00a0Since the last update on March 9, 2023, the agricultural, cereal, and export price indices closed 3 percent, 2 percent, and 2 percent lower, respectively. The global economy\u2019s \u201cspeed limit\u201d\u2014the maximum long-term rate at which it can grow without sparking inflation\u2014is set to slump to a three-decade low by 2030. A World Bank report\u2014Falling Long-Term Growth Prospects: Trends, Expectations, and Policies\u2014shows that an ambitious policy push can boost productivity, ramp up investment, and harness the potential of the services sector. The World Bank has two goals: end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way.                                 Food security is defined when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.                                                              Climate change, poverty, and inequality are the defining issues of our age. The World Bank Group is the biggest multilateral funder of climate investments in developing countries.                                                             IDA is the part of the World Bank that helps the world\u2019s poorest countries.

In 2022, the global average score on the World Bank\u2019s\u00a0Women, Business and the Law\u00a0index rose just half a point to 77.1\u2014indicating women, on average, enjoy barely 77 percent of the legal rights that men do. At the current pace of reform, in many countries a woman entering the workforce today will retire before she will be able to gain the same rights as men, the report notes. This year, 18 countries enacted 34 reforms, the lowest number of reforms in 20 years. But more than half of all reforms captured were implemented in the Sub-Saharan Africa region by seven economies.

Globally, roughly half of working age women participate in the labor force, which is significantly lower than the male labor force participation rate of around 80%.\u00a0\u00a0This gap is virtually unchanged from what it was three decades ago. And there are\u00a0sizeable differences\u00a0in the level of female labor force participation across regions.\u00a0Moreover, women tend to face inferior income opportunities and on average earn less than men.\u00a0Explore more aspects of female labor force participation through\u00a0this data story.\u00a0  According to the\u00a0latest statistics\u00a0(see below),\u00a0more than one in five women were first married before the age of 18, with the practice of child marriage being most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.\u00a0Beyond being a human rights violation, child marriage also\u00a0greatly undermines women\u2019s and girls\u2019 economic opportunities. It limits child brides\u2019 access to education, reduces their future earnings, jeopardizes their health, and puts them at a heightened risk of domestic violence. Data on the economic impacts of child marriage provide the foundation for advocacy campaigns to end the practice. Learn more.
