I\u2019m Theresa Mabe, a visually impaired, digital accessibility advocate with a passion for travel, entertainment, and style.\u00a0 Central Maryland has always been home, but I jump at any opportunity to hope on a plane and visit new or familiar destinations \u2013 especially if Disney, food, or baseball is involved. I\u2019m a DisneyBounder at heart, a marketing data analyst by trade, and I\u2019ll challenge anybody to a game of \u201cYou know what else that actor was in?\u201d In additional to creating accessible content and sharing digital accessibility tips online, I\u2019m also available for social media and web accessibility auditing, on site training, and speaking engagements. Want to know more about me, how we can work together, or looking to request a media kit?\u00a0 Send me an email at InSightFullLife@gmail.com! In Sight: Full Life began as a way to be a voice and resource for others diagnosed with myopic macular degeneration and other visual impairments, and sharing how losing my vision wasn\u2019t going to stop me from living my life. \u00a0While that is still the overwhelming theme and purpose of the content I create, I now place heavier emphasis on my blog and social media accounts in sharing news, stories, and tips centered around making travel, style, and entertainment more accessible. While earning my degree in digital media and web technology, I was diagnosed with a condition that has caused me to have progression vision loss. Rather than dwell on the uncertainty of my future, I looked at this as an opportunity: to use my personal experience and educational background to become a digital accessibility advocate, educating organizations, content creators, and anybody who shares information on the internet how they can amplify their message by reducing digital barriers. Popular Post:\u00a0 Creating an Accessible Instagram Account Growing up, my dad always had\u00a0Turner Classic Movies on in our house (usually on more than one tv at a time), so it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of my top 10 favorite films were made in the 1960s or earlier. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m stuck in the past!\u00a0 I love a variety of entertainment genres and exploring what goes into making the content we all enjoy.\u00a0 In addition to reviewing television and film, I\u2019m always on the lookout to highlight stories within entertainment that promote representation and inclusion, whether it\u2019s on the screen, behind the camera, or in the studio. I feel like this is also the place to brag that\u00a0Jessie Maltin\u00a0has listed me as one of her favorite \u201cfilm/movie buff/cinephile nerd accounts\u201d to follow on Twitter, so be sure to check me out there as well, @GertieTheDino.

I love creating fun (and affordable) character-inspired DisneyBounds.\u00a0 I try to exclusively use items from my closet, and only resort to buying something if I know I\u2019ll wear it regularly or can use it to represent multiple characters.\u00a0 You can see all of my Disney outfits on my Instagram, @in.sight.full.life! Outside of clothing, most visually impaired people will tell you that given some of our sight limitations, there are specific tools, tips, and products we gravitate towards.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t heard: automatic curling wands are one of the greatest inventions of our time.

I want to see, do and eat it all. Popular Post: Walt Disney World Planning Tips for Large Families In February 2014, I was diagnosed with\u00a0myopic macular degeneration, caused by\u00a0pathological myopia. A lot of words that essentially mean I severely near-sighted and the strain on my retina is resulting in deterioration of my central vision. Although this has prompted me to make a lot of adjustments in my life, it\u2019s also made me recognize how few resources exist for those with myopic macular degeneration.\u00a0 One of my primary goals with starting this website is to provide guidance and encouragement for anyone else who has ever felt overwhelmed or isolated after receiving a similar diagnosis, and sharing what I\u2019ve learned about myself and this condition from my own personal experiences.
