The series, which is produced by the Department                    of State's Office of the Historian, began in 1861 and now                    comprises more than 450 individual volumes. The volumes published over the last                    two decades increasingly contain declassified records from all the foreign                    affairs agencies. Foreign Relations volumes contain documents from Presidential                    libraries, Departments of State and Defense, National Security Council, Central                    Intelligence Agency, Agency for International Development, and other foreign                    affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in                    formulating U.S. foreign policy. In general, the editors choose documentation                    that illuminates policy formulation and major aspects and repercussions of its                    execution. Volumes published during the last three decades have expanded the                    scope of the series by including documents from a wider range of government                    agencies, particularly those involved with intelligence activity and covert                    actions. Volumes in the series since 1952 are organized chronologically according to                    Presidential administrations, and geographically and topically within each                    subseries: 65 volumes cover the Nixon and Ford administrations (1969-1976), 32 cover the Carter administration                    (1977-1980), and about 49 are scheduled for the Reagan administration                    (1981-1988). Volumes on the George H.W. Bush administration are now being researched, annotated,                        and prepared for publication. Volumes may be purchased through the U.S. Government Publishing Office (202-512-1800). Recent volumes are                    also available online.
