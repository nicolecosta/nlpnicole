Social media is an umbrella term for platforms that enable users to post media (images, text, videos) to the platform and interact with other users. While specific motivations may vary, the general purpose of social media is to publicly share an aspect of your life. On Facebook that may be a misinformed political rant, on Twitter a witty remark about a viral topic, on Instagram a #humblebrag snapshot of your recent vacation, on TikTok a lip-sync video or cringe-y attempt at a new dance trend. Social media is also a major way to get news (accuracy varies wildly) learn about new trends, stay in touch with friends, and read/view apologies by influencers and celebrities who did something stupid on said platform.", "url": "https://mashable.com/category/social-media", "threshold": 0.06626639943114965}
