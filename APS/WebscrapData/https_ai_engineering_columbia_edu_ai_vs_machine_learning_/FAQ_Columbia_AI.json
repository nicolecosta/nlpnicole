How much is the enrollment deposit/down payment? The enrollment deposit is $500, nonrefundable, and is applied to the cost of program fees for the program. What are the funding options available for AI executive certificate learners? Learners have several funding options, including employer support and private loans. At this time, the program is not eligible for military/veteran benefits. Some employers will provide support to help you advance your education. Consider the following: How does my employer go about paying the school? Sponsored learners are those whose educations at Columbia University are funded directly by a third party, called a sponsor. Examples of sponsors include employers, educational institutions, government agencies, foundations, or other institutional sources. For sponsors that require Columbia to send an invoice for educational costs directly to them, the third-party billing is handled by the Columbia Video Network (CVN) registration team. For more details, please email registration@cvn.columbia.edu. When will my employer be billed? Employers who provide a voucher to Columbia confirming program fee is covered are billed after the first week of class. This marks the end of the Enrollment Change period, after which you are no longer eligible for a program fee refund. Otherwise, learners can provide an invoice to their employer for direct payment to the university. Can I defer program fees based on reimbursement from my employer? Learners who pay Columbia first and are subsequently reimbursed by their employers are not handled by the CVN or Columbia University Student Financial Services. Learners who receive reimbursement upon submission of grades or completion of sponsor terms must adhere to the University\u2019s established payment due dates. Does the Columbia AI certificate program offer institutional scholarships for this program? Please inquire with your enrollment advisor about scholarship availability. Do I qualify for federal financial aid? Learners in this program are not eligible to apply for Title IV federal financial aid. However, you may want to consider private education funding. What are private bank loans? Private student loans, also known as alternative education loans, help bridge the gap between the actual cost of your education and the limited amount the government allows you to borrow in its programs. Private loans are offered by private lenders, and there are no federal forms to complete. Before you and your family begin to explore your loan options, we ask that you read the University\u2019s Disclosure Concerning Lender Selection. In addition to the three disclosures by the Truth in Lending Act, all private education loan borrowers must complete a Private Education Loan Applicant Self-Certification form and submit the form to their lender of choice before the private loan can be processed. Are there any private loans that Columbia University recommends? The University has selected suggested lenders based on several factors, including cost and eligibility, benefits to borrowers, and overall customer service. Information about the process can be found in the University\u2019s Disclosure Concerning Lender Selection noted above. You can view the suggested lender list. ELM select is an external website that allows learners to review the suggested lender list(s), compare products, and apply for private loans. Please note: Learners have the right and ability to select the lender of their choice and are not required to use any of the lenders on the suggested lender list. Learners are encouraged to shop around to find the lender offering the rates, terms, and service that are right for them. When will I receive a program fee bill, and when is payment due?

What are the consequences if my bill is not paid by the bill due date? Payments must be posted by the due date listed to avoid late charges. Review details regarding unpaid bills. Do I have to repay any student loans I currently have while I\u2019m in school? If you have outstanding federal student loans that you have been awarded as a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, you may be eligible to defer payment if you are enrolled at least half-time. You can learn more by visiting the Federal Student Aid website. Most private loans also have deferred payment options while you are in school; however, you\u2019ll want to check with your loan servicer. You should be aware that although you can defer payments while you are in school, interest will still accrue on your loan(s). Can military education benefits be used for this program? The program is not currently eligible for certification for military benefits. How do I qualify for a program fee tax credit? For details on tax benefits for education, see IRS Publication 970: Tax Benefits for Education, which provides detailed information. Columbia University is unable to provide tax advice.
