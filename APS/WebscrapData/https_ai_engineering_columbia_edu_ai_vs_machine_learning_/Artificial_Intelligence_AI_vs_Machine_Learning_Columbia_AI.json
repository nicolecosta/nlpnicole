{"title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine Learning | Columbia AI", "content": "Home / Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine Learning Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are often used interchangeably, but machine learning is a subset of the broader category of AI. Put in context, artificial intelligence refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human\u00a0thought and perform tasks in real-world environments, while machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data.\u00a0 Computer programmers and software developers enable computers to analyze data and solve problems \u2014 essentially, they create artificial intelligence systems \u2014 by applying tools such as: Below is a breakdown of the differences between artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as how they are being applied in organizations large and small today. Artificial Intelligence is the field of developing computers and robots that are capable of behaving in ways that both mimic and go beyond human capabilities. AI-enabled programs can analyze and contextualize data to provide information or automatically trigger actions without human interference. Today, artificial intelligence is at the heart of many technologies we use, including smart devices and voice assistants such as Siri on Apple devices. Companies are incorporating techniques such as natural language processing and computer vision \u2014 the ability for computers to use human language and interpret images \u00ad\u2014 to automate tasks, accelerate decision making, and enable customer conversations with chatbots. Machine learning is a pathway to artificial intelligence. This subcategory of AI uses algorithms to automatically learn insights and recognize patterns from data, applying that learning to make increasingly better decisions. By studying and experimenting with machine learning, programmers test the limits of how much they can improve the perception, cognition, and action of a computer system. Deep learning, an advanced method of machine learning, goes a step further. Deep learning models use large neural networks \u2014 networks that function like a human brain to logically analyze data \u2014 to learn complex patterns and make predictions independent of human input. To be successful in nearly any industry, organizations must be able to transform their data into actionable insight. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning give organizations the advantage of automating a variety of manual processes involving data and decision making. By incorporating AI and machine learning into their systems and strategic plans, leaders can understand and act on data-driven insights with greater speed and efficiency. Efficiency is key to the success of an organization in the manufacturing industry. Artificial intelligence can help manufacturing leaders automate their business processes by applying data analytics and machine learning to applications such as the following: Data privacy and security are especially critical within the banking industry. Financial services leaders can keep customer data secure while increasing efficiencies using AI and machine learning in several ways: The health care field uses huge amounts of data and increasingly relies on informatics and analytics to provide accurate, efficient health services. AI tools can help improve patient outcomes, save time, and even help providers avoid burnout by: Learn more about how AI is changing the world of health care.
