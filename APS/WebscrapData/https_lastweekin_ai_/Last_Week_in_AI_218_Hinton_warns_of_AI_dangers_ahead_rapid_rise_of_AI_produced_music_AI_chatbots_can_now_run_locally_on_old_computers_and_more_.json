{"title": "Last Week in AI #218: Hinton warns of AI dangers ahead, rapid rise of AI-produced music, AI chatbots can now run locally on old computers, and more!", "content": "Geoffrey Hinton, the pioneering AI scientist behind the foundation for modern deep learning and AI chatbot systems, warns of the dangers of generative AI, the technology behind chatbots like ChatGPT, after quitting his job at Google. Hinton, who was with Google for over a decade, notes the concerns around AI causing potential harm \u2013 pushing out misinformation, causing job loss, and posing risks to humanity. Despite advancements in AI being embraced by industry leaders, Hinton insists that the competition between tech giants like Google and Microsoft could lead to danger if it continues uninhibited. Our take: Hinton's recent departure from Google following his concerns about generative AI serves as a wake-up call to the tech industry. Cutting-edge AI developments have the potential for significant societal impact, but they also come with drawbacks that have yet to be fully explored. Hinton's apprehension showcases the need for responsible technological stewardship that considers ethical consequences and implications. Policymakers, industry leaders, and the academic community must strive for a balance between innovation and safeguarding against theoretical and emerging risks related to AI's potential harms. The tech giants should prioritize the development of global regulations to avoid potential AI arms-races and work together to enhance the control, safety, and ethical use of AI systems. AI-generated music, featuring vocals mimicking famous artists' voices, has surged in popularity, sparking debate and causing copyright issues in the music industry. Creators within the AI music community, such as AI Hub, defend the technology, arguing it makes music more accessible, while industry professionals and critics claim copyright infringement and cultural appropriation. AI music may take away artists' rights to fair compensation, as major record labels take legal action against these AI-created songs. The rise in AI music questions the balance between creative freedom, technology capabilities, and a need for ethical and legal constraints in the evolving AI-influenced industry. Our take: AI music's growing prevalence necessitates clear legal and ethical frameworks to protect artists' rights and address concerns of cultural appropriation, while respecting the creative advances technology offers. A collaborative approach among stakeholders, policymakers, and AI music creators could help strike a balance between freedom of expression and artists' intellectual property rights. This can contribute to avoiding an unhealthy race for AI-generated music and focus on harnessing the potential benefits of AI to foster industry innovation \u2013 with the ultimate aim of benefiting both creators and consumers. Machine Learning Compilation is an open-source project that has developed a lightweight chatbot capable of running locally on various devices, including iPhones and older PCs with integrated graphics. By employing MLC, the model is slimmed down and can process efficiently on a wide range of systems. The project was developed by MLC AI and has contributions from several reputable institutions. Although the current iteration of MLC LLM chatbot is not as advanced as GPT3.5 or GPT4, it offers the advantage of improved privacy and reduced dependency on the internet for functionality. Our Take: The development of MLC LLM offers an intriguing glimpse into the potential future of chatbots running locally on a wide array of devices. This not only offers users increased privacy by keeping their data local but also allows operation in areas with limited or no internet access. While the quality of the responses generated by the chatbot may currently be subpar compared to more advanced models, it's essential to remember that this is an initial iteration. As AI and machine learning models improve, the prospect of more powerful and versatile chatbots running on a diverse range of devices becomes increasingly plausible.  A.I.
