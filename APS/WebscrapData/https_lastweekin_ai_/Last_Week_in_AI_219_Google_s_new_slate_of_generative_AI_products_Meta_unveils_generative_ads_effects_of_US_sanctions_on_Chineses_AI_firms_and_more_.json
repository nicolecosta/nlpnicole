{"title": "Last Week in AI #219: Google's new slate of generative AI products, Meta unveils generative ads, effects of US sanctions on Chineses AI firms, and more!", "content": "Google introduced PaLM 2 at Google I/O last week. The model is the company\u2019s latest language model that has improved multilingual, reasoning, and coding capabilities. PaLM 2 is trained on multilingual texts from over 100 languages and has mastery in advanced language proficiency exams. It demonstrates enhanced capabilities in logic, common sense reasoning, and mathematics due to its wide-ranging dataset. The model can write popular programming languages like Python and JavaScript as well as more specialized ones like Prolog, Fortran, and Verilog. Available in four different sizes, PaLM 2 already powers over 25 Google products and features, like Gmail and Google Docs. Other announcements at Google I/O include removing the waitlist for Bard and Gemini, the next-generation AI model currently in training, which will have enhanced multi-modal and tool-use capabilities. Our take: This event was much anticipated as Microsoft made the first moves toward incorporating the latest in generative AI into products. Google\u2019s ambitious launch of an entirely new slate of AI products seems to have answered the call. It should be clear now that tech companies are pushing full steam ahead on AI, and the speed of both AI model development and deployment are only accelerating. I\u2019m eager to find out how OpenAI/Microsoft, as well as other companies respond in the second half of 2023. Meta is introducing the AI Sandbox, a testing platform for generative AI-powered advertising tools. This includes features like Text Variation, Background Generation, and Image Outcropping to make ads more engaging and efficient. Initially available to a small group, the AI Sandbox will be expanded to more advertisers in July. Additionally, Meta is enhancing the Meta Advantage suite of ad automation tools, allowing advertisers to leverage AI more effectively and flexibly. Our Take: The introduction of the AI Sandbox and improvements to the Meta Advantage suite demonstrate Meta's evolving focus on integrating artificial intelligence into advertising. As these new tools and features not only streamline ad creation and audience targeting but also reduce the manual labor required for crafting effective ads, the advertising landscape is poised for a significant shift. This may mark a change in perception of Meta\u2019s AI endeavors as the company is seen as playing catch-up in the latest generative AI craze started by ChatGPT. It has been months since the US imposed extensive restrictions on China's access to advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Biden Administration's move was a real attempt to hobble China's capacity for training AI systems at scale. Matt Sheehan described the move as a bet, and in a conversation with me asked whether China might yet be able to do something interesting with trailing-edge (not state-of-the-art) chips. Indeed, a WSJ review of research papers and employee interviews found that Chinese researchers are looking at ways to face restrictions by using fewer or less powerful semiconductors to train state-of-the-art AI systems. While companies such as Baidu stockpiled A100 chips before the US rules came into effect, they have heavily restricted internal use and reserved these chips only for the most computationally intensive tasks. Our Take: The two paths for China, given the severity of the Biden restrictions, were to (1) develop in-house capacity for producing high-end semiconductors or (2) work with what they've got. I asked Andrew Feldman of Cerebras about (1), and his perception was that it would take a very long time for China to develop internal capability to produce the advanced semiconductors they're being cut off from, given the further restrictions on the tools needed to make those semiconductors (in a sense, they would have to work from the ground up to develop capacity). (2) seems difficult, but maybe easier than (1) if the right training techniques can be developed. It sounds like there are a few promising techniques out there. My thought is that if these techniques do allow China to develop the sort of AI systems the US is able to train at our scale, then China will need to keep a lockdown on those techniques to maintain its competitiveness. If those techniques leak (and scale in the appropriate way), we'll just use them to jump further ahead Reflected Diffusion Models - \"In this blog post, we will be discussing our recent work on Reflected Diffusion Models, which explores this connection to develop a new class of diffusion models which correctly trains for thresholded sampling and respects general boundary constraints.\" Advanced Prompt Engineering - \"What to do when few-shot learning isn't enough...\" Language models can explain neurons in language models - \"Our method currently has many limitations, which we hope can be addressed in future work.
