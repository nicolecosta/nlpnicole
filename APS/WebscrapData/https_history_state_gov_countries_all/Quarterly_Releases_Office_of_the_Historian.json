The series, which is produced by the Department                    of State's Office of the Historian, began in 1861 and now                    comprises more than 450 individual volumes. The volumes published over the last                    two decades increasingly contain declassified records from all the foreign                    affairs agencies. Foreign Relations volumes contain documents from Presidential                    libraries, Departments of State and Defense, National Security Council, Central                    Intelligence Agency, Agency for International Development, and other foreign                    affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in                    formulating U.S. foreign policy. In general, the editors choose documentation                    that illuminates policy formulation and major aspects and repercussions of its                    execution. Volumes published during the last three decades have expanded the                    scope of the series by including documents from a wider range of government                    agencies, particularly those involved with intelligence activity and covert                    actions. Volumes in the series since 1952 are organized chronologically according to                    Presidential administrations, and geographically and topically within each                    subseries: 65 volumes cover the Nixon and Ford administrations (1969-1976), 32 cover the Carter administration                    (1977-1980), and about 49 are scheduled for the Reagan administration                    (1981-1988). Volumes on the George H.W. Bush administration are now being researched, annotated,                        and prepared for publication. Volumes may be purchased through the U.S. Government Publishing Office (202-512-1800). Recent volumes are                    also available online.

Browse official documents from the Foreign Relations of the United                            States series. history@state.gov Phone: 202-955-0200 Fax: 202-955-0268  From 2016 to 2018, the Office of the Historian released newly digitized                            volumes in the Foreign Relations of the United States series on                            a quarterly basis. This initiative was carried out in partnership with                            the University of Wisconsin Digital Collections Center. The University                            graciously provided the Office with high quality scanned images of the                            series covering 1861\u20131960, and the Office then further digitized the                            text from these images and enriched the text to create a full text                            searchable edition. With the print volumes now complete, the Office has begun digitizing                            microfiche supplements from the series. Each volume undergoes two                            phases: first, a \"preview edition\" is prepared, containing the front                            matter booklet and PDFs of the documents; then, as resources allow, a                            full text edition is prepared, replacing the preview edition. The most recent releases are summarized in the list below, with a link                            leading to the full list of volumes included in the release and the                            announcement.
