{"title": "Drew A. Hudson", "content": "dorarad [at] cs.stanford.edu\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[scholar] [github] [linkedin] [twitter]  I am a final year PhD student at Stanford University, Computer Science.  I am a member of the Stanford AI Lab and also affiliated with the NLP group.                 My research focuses on reasoning, compositionality, and representation learning, at the intersection of vision and language.                 I explore structural principles and inductive biases for making neural networks more interpretable, robust and data-efficient, and allow them to generalize effectively and systematically from a few samples only. I believe in the importance of multi-disciplinary both within the AI field and across domains, and draw high-level inspiration from the feats of the human mind, including its structural properties as well as cognitive capabilities.                 I believe that compositionality is a key ingredient that, if incorporated successfully into neural models, may help bridging the gap between machine intelligence and natural intelligence. I explore ways to achieve compositionality both in terms of computation and representation.                                                   Towards the former, I introduced, together with my advisor, models such as MAC and the Neural State Machine that perform transparent step-by-step reasoning, as well as the GQA dataset for real-world visual question answering.                 Towards the latter, I began more recently to explore ways to learn compositional scene representations, and along with Larry, presented the Generative Adversarial Transformers, for fast, data-efficient and high-resolution image synthesis. I am actively researching this subject further and hope to present new findings on this exciting direction in the near future!
