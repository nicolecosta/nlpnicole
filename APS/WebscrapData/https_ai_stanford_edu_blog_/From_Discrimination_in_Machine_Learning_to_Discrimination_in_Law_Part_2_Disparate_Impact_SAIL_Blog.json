{"title": "From Discrimination in Machine Learning to Discrimination in Law, Part 2: Disparate Impact | SAIL Blog", "content": "Fereshte Khani,  Percy LiangDecember 23, 2022  \u201cSimple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes or results in racial discrimination.\u201d John F. Kennedy, 1963 This blog post is the second of a series about discrimination in law and it explains one form of discrimination known as disparate impact  (see first part about disparate treatment). It is based on CM-604 Theories of Discrimination (Title VII) and chapters 6 and 7 of TITLE VI Legal Manual.  This blog post assists researchers in identifying and mitigating discriminatory models by providing a parallel between proving discrimination in law and proving discrimination in machine learning. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the protected attributes. Most employers with at least 15 employees are covered by EEOC laws. EEOC charges around 90000 cases each year, of which around 15% result in monetary benefit for the charging party. ( ~300 million dollars per year). The processing time for each charge usually takes ten months. Anti-discrimination laws are designed to prevent discrimination based on one of the following protected attributes: Disparate impact occurs when policies/practices that appear neutral result in a disproportionate impact on a protected group without any business necessity 2. Business necessity is context dependent; for example, a university that hires professors can argue that having a Ph.D. for employment is necessary (although this requirement might cause a disproportionate impact for different races); however, the university cannot argue something like physical strength as a business necessity (which lead to disproportionate impact for different genders).  The legal procedure for proving disparate impact consists of three steps (figure below): In a disparate treatment case, the charging party must only prove that the correspondent is using the protected attribute for its decision. On the other hand, in the disparate impact case, in addition to proving that there is a disparate impact, the charging party needs to show that there is no business necessity for the policy or there is an alternative that leads to the same performance but less disparate impact.  A middle school has a \u201czero tolerance\u201d tardiness policy. Late students must stay in the principal\u2019s office for the rest of the class period regardless of their reason for tardiness.  Step 1: Proof of disparate impact: The evidence shows that Asian-American students are disproportionately losing instruction time under the school\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d tardiness policy. A further investigation reveals that whites and Hispanics are more likely to live within walking distance of the school, while Asian-American students typically live farther away and must take public transportation. Even if they take the first bus available in the morning, they are often dropped off after school starts. Step 2: Justification: As justification for the \u201czero tolerance\u201d tardiness policy, the school articulates the goals of reducing disruption caused by tardiness and encouraging good attendance, all of which the federal funding agency accepts as important educational goals. Step 3: Assessment of justification and alternatives: The plaintiff first assesses the justification\u2014 including whether the policy is reasonably likely to reduce tardiness for these students under these circumstances. If the justification is valid, the plaintiff would then investigate alternatives that would achieve the important educational goals while reducing the adverse impact on Asian-American students (e.g., aligning class schedules and bus schedules). If such alternatives are present, the school is violating Title VI. Proving disparate impact involves four substeps: As the first step, the charging party should Identify the policy or practice that allegedly caused disparate harm. In the second step, the charging party should identify the kind of harm. Examples include fewer or inferior services or benefits, distribution of burdens and negative effects, threatened or imminent harm, etc. In the third step, the charging party should show that a disproportionate share of the adversity/harm is on protected groups. For doing so, they first need to define the correct population base (individuals affected by the policy or who may be affected by changes to or elimination of the policy). Secondly, they should determine that the disparity is large enough to matter (i.e., is it sufficiently significant to establish a legal violation)4. In the last step, the charging party should show that the policy actually caused that effect. A disparate impact claim is not valid if the evidence shows that even without the challenged practice, the same disparate impact would have existed. In particular, the Supreme Court has emphasized that entities should not be \u201cheld liable for racial disparities they did not create.\u201d5 In this step, the respondent should articulate a \u201csubstantial legitimate justification\u201d for the challenged policy or practice. Agencies should thoroughly investigate the facts to determine whether these rationales are supported by sufficient evidence. Example11. Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001). James Alexander, Director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety, ordered that the test for Alabama driver\u2019s license test needs to be done in English. Martha Sandoval sued Alexander and claimed that the English-only test policy was discriminatory. The state agency offered several justifications for the English-only rule: highway safety concerns, exam administration difficulties, exam integrity, and budgetary constraints. The district court found that the recipient had produced no evidence at trial that non-English speakers posed a greater driving safety risk than English speakers; the recipient had undermined its own safety argument by recognizing valid licenses from non-English speakers of other locales; making test accommodations for illiterate, deaf, and disabled drivers; and having previously offered the examination in fourteen languages without administrative difficulty. The court further noted that cost had not been a real factor in making the decision to administer the examination only in English and that the recipient could afford the costs of language assistance in light of its $50 million dollar budget. Affirming the district court, the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the state agency\u2019s rationales constituted a pretext for the policy.  If the justification were valid, the investigating agency should investigate if there are equally effective alternative practices with less disparate impact. \u201cUnder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the EEOC charged that in the year 2000 Allstate adopted a hiring moratorium for a period of one year, or while severance benefits were being received, that applied to all its employee-sales agents who were part of its \u2018\u2018Preparing  For The Future Reorganization Program\u2019. The program was part of Allstate\u2019s reorganization from employee agents to what the company considered independent contractors. The EEOC alleged that the policy had a disproportionate impact on Allstate\u2019s employees over the age of 40 because more than 90 percent of the agents subjected to the hiring moratorium were 40 years of age or older.\u201d Ramifications: \u201cAllstate Insurance Company, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, for $4,500,000 to approximately 90 older former employees, in addition to significant remedial relief.\u201d \u201cCSXT Transportation conducted isokinetic strength testing as a requirement for workers to be hired for various jobs. The EEOC said that the strength test used by CSXT, known as the \u201cIPCS Biodex\u201d test, caused an unlawful discriminatory impact on female workers seeking jobs as conductors, material handler/clerks, and a number of other job categories. The EEOC also charged that CSXT used two other employment tests, a three-minute step test seeking to measure aerobic capacity and a discontinued arm endurance test, as a requirement for selection into certain jobs, and that those tests also caused an unlawful discriminatory effect on female workers.\u201d Ramifications: \u201cCSXT had to pay them $3.2 Million to settle the disparate impact sex discrimination case.\u201d \u201cDollar General, the largest small-box discount retailer in the United States, violated federal law by denying employment to African Americans at a significantly higher rate than white applicants for failing the company\u2019s broad criminal background check. Employment screens that have a disparate impact on the basis of race violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, unless an employer can show the screen is job-related and is a business necessity.\u201d Ramifications: Dollar General had to pay $6 million and furnish other relief to settle a class race discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Title VII (Theories of discrimination) prohibited 5 kinds of discrimination in employment. Our previous post covered disparate treatment; this post covers disparate impact; for completeness, we will briefly mention other types of discrimination here. This kind of discrimination occurs when a neutral employment system continues to perpetuate the effects of past discrimination.  For proving the perpetuation of past discrimination, the charging party must establish a causal connection between the past discrimination and the current policy\u2019s adverse effects. Example. Jamal claims that GE refuses to hire Blacks as summer employees.  GE contends that it gives preference to the children of employees.  Prior to 1964, GE employed very few Blacks due to discriminatory hiring practices.  The policy of giving a preference to the children of employees perpetuates GE\u2019s past discriminatory practices. This type of discrimination occurs by failing to accommodate a prospective or existing employee\u2019s disability or religious practices. The charging party can establish a case by showing that they informed the respondent of the accommodation, but the respondent fails to accommodate (note that there is no need to compare similarly situated individuals or show adverse impacts). In response, the respondent can show that accommodation would have created an undue hardship on the conduct of its business. Title VII prohibits discrimination against individuals because they have filed a Title VII charge, have participated in a Title VII investigation, or have otherwise opposed Title VII discrimination. Discrimination in law has been studied for over seven decades now. There are definitions and clear procedures for proving discrimination. The procedure involves two parties: (1) the charging party who tries to show discrimination has happened and (2) the respondent who tries to show that the charging party\u2019s evidence is not valid. Understanding their process and the challenges will help ML researchers develop better methods to facilitate auditing models and develop mitigation methods.
