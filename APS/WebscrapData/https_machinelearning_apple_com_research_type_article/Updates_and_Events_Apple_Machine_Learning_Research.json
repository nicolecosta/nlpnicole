ICLR brings together professionals dedicated to the advancement of deep learning. Below is the schedule of Apple sponsored workshops and events at ICLR 2023.  Apple is sponsoring the ACM Human-Computer Interaction conference (CHI), which will be held as a hybrid virtual and in person conference from April 23 - 28 in Hamburg, Germany. CHI is the premier international conference on Human-Computer Interaction. Apple sponsored the Neural Information Processing Systems Conference (NeurIPS), which was held in New Orleans, Louisiana from November 28 to December 9. NeurIPS is a global conference focused on fostering the exchange of research on neural information processing systems in their biological, technological, mathematical, and theoretical aspects. Apple sponsored Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), which was held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from December 7 to 11. EMNLP is a leading conference focused on natural language processing. Apple sponsored the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), which was held in Tel Aviv, Israel from October 23 to 27. ECCV is the top European conference in the image analysis area. Apple sponsored the 34th Interspeech conference, which was held in Incheon, Republic of Korea from September 18 to 22. Interspeech is a global conference focused on cognitive intelligence for speech processing and application. Apple sponsored the 28th annual ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD). KDD was held in Washington D.C. from August 14 to 18. It is an interdisciplinary conference bringing together researchers and practitioners from data science, data mining, knowledge discovery, large-scale data analytics, and big data. Apple sponsored the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) which was held in Baltimore, Maryland from July 17 to 23. ICML is a conference dedicated to the advancement of machine learning. Earlier this year, Apple hosted the Workshop on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML). This virtual event brought Apple and members of the academic research communities together to discuss the state of the art in the field of privacy-preserving machine learning through a series of talks and discussions over two days. Apple sponsored the IEEE / CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR), which will be held in New Orleans, Louisiana from June 19 to 24. CVPR is an annual computer vision conference with several workshops and short courses. Apple sponsored the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), which was held in a hybrid format from May 22 to 27. ACL is the premier conference of the field of computational linguistics, covering a broad spectrum of diverse research areas that are concerned with computational approaches to natural language.  Apple sponsored Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), which was held in a hybrid format. The virtual event took place on May 7 to 13, and the hybrid main conference on May 22 to 27. ICASSP is the IEEE Signal Processing Society\u2019s flagship conference on signal processing and its applications. Our research in machine learning breaks new ground every day.
