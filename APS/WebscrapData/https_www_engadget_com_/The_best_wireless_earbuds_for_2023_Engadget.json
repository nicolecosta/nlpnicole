There\u2019s no doubt the popularity of Apple\u2019s AirPods helped make them a mainstay, but plenty of others offer reliable connectivity, great sound and active noise cancellation (ANC) in increasingly smaller form factors. You can also get features that used to be reserved for premium models on mid-range devices. Of course, the popularity means that new earbuds are popping up all the time and the list of options is longer than ever. To help, we\u2019ve compiled our top picks for the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, including noteworthy features for each.

Sony keeps its top spot on our list for its combination of great sound quality, powerful active noise cancellation and a long list of features no other company can compete with. As with its headphones, Sony manages to pack a ton of handy tools into its flagship true wireless earbuds. The basics like wireless charging and battery life improvements are covered, but company-specific features like Speak-to-Chat automatic pausing, Adaptive Sound Control adjustments based on movement or location, 360 Reality Audio and a customizable EQ are icing on the cake. Plus, DSEE Extreme upscaling helps improve compressed tunes over Bluetooth.

If sound quality is your primary concern, the Momentum True Wireless 3 is your best bet for a top notch listening experience. You won\u2019t get the truckload of features that Sony offers, but Sennheiser does the basics well at a lower price than the previous Momentum earbuds. A new Adaptive Noise Cancellation setup continuously monitors ambient sounds to suppress them in real time. Inside, the company\u2019s True Response transducer is paired with 7mm dynamic drivers for top-notch audio.

When it comes to blocking out the world, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II are the best at the task. Bose introduced a redesigned active noise canceling set earlier this year and the smaller pair of earbuds deliver a more comfy fit. The company also managed to improve ambient sound and maintain its track record of solid audio quality. However, the real star here is the ANC performance which is hands-down the best you can get right now. The high-end QC Earbuds II don\u2019t have some basic features like multipoint connectivity and wireless charging, so that might factor into your decision.

Jabra packs a lot into a set of earbuds for under $100. The Elite 3 don\u2019t have ANC, automatic pausing or wireless charging, and the EQ changes are limited to presets. However, these affordable buds have impressive sound quality, good battery life, reliable on-board controls and a very comfy fit. If you\u2019re looking for the best earbuds to just get the job done, the Elite 3 are more than capable and are the best buy at this price.

Apple\u2019s latest AirPods Pro are a huge improvement over the 2019 model. The company managed to improve the sound quality and active noise cancellation while keeping all of the conveniences that make AirPods the best earbud option for iOS and Mac. To me, the most impressive feature is the transparency mode, which is more natural sounding than any other earbuds by a mile. You can leave these in during a conversation and it\u2019s like you\u2019re not even wearing them. Of course, fast pairing, hands-free Siri and wireless charging (MagSafe or Apple Watch chargers) will also come in handy.

Google has hit its stride when it comes to true wireless earbuds. Every new model the company introduces is an improvement after its first attempt failed to impress. With the Pixel Buds Pro, Google offers deep, punchy bass, solid ANC performance, reliable touch controls and wireless charging. Plus, there are added convenience features for Android and Pixel devices including Google Translate Conversation Mode.

Most of the best AirPods features in a set of workout earbuds? That\u2019s the Beats Fit Pro. Thanks to Apple\u2019s H1 chip, these buds offer one-touch quick pairing, hands-free Siri and Find My tools. They\u2019ll also allow you to use Audio Sharing with an Apple device and another set of AirPods or Beats wireless headphones for tandem listening or viewing. Balanced and punchy bass will keep the energy up during workouts while good noise cancellation and a comfy ear tip fit make these a solid option outside of the gym too. And there\u2019s plenty of support for Android, so these aren\u2019t just a good buy for iOS users either. Read our Full Review of Beats Fit Pro Wireless Earbuds Honorable mentionSonySony LinkBuds SThese tiny buds muster some punch when it comes to sound quality, and support for high-res listening (LDAC and DSEE Extreme) are both onboard.                    $148 at Amazon                                        $200 at Target                 These tiny buds muster some punch when it comes to sound quality, and support for high-res listening (LDAC and DSEE Extreme) are both onboard. One of the biggest surprises this year wasn\u2019t Sony\u2019s unique open-wear LinkBuds, it was the more mainstream follow-up. With the LinkBuds S, the company debuted a more \u201ctraditional\u201d design akin to its premium WF-1000XM4, only this model is much smaller and lighter which leads to a much more comfy fit. These tiny wireless earbuds muster some punch when it comes to sound quality too and support for high-res listening (LDAC and DSEE Extreme) are both onboard. Capable ANC lends a hand with environmental noise and transparency mode can keep you tuned in when needed. What\u2019s more, handy Speak-to-Chat is here and Adaptive Sound Control can automatically change settings based on activity or location. That\u2019s a lot of premium for features at a mid-range price. Comparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 3 is also outstanding. With new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we\u2019ve reviewed are Audio-Technica\u2019s ATH-CKS5TW. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, Master & Dynamic\u2019s MW08 offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries. There are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you\u2019ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you\u2019ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn\u2019t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn\u2019t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water. A secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like fit wings or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You\u2019ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don\u2019t fit well return them. PlayStation 5 doesn\u2019t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even Sony\u2019s own gaming headsets come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html", "threshold": 0.9999999999999996}
