{"title": "Imagen: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models", "content": " Google Research, Brain Team           We present Imagen, a text-to-image diffusion model with an unprecedented degree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding.          Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation.          Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly          effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text          alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model.          Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters find Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment.          To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models.          With DrawBench, we compare Imagen with recent methods including VQ-GAN+CLIP, Latent Diffusion Models, and DALL-E 2, and find that human raters prefer Imagen over other models in side-by-side comparisons, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment.                   More from the Imagen family:         Visualization of Imagen. Imagen uses a large frozen T5-XXL encoder to encode the input text into embeddings. A conditional diffusion model maps the text embedding into a 64\u00d764 image. Imagen further utilizes text-conditional super-resolution diffusion models to upsample the image 64\u00d764\u2192256\u00d7256 and 256\u00d7256\u21921024\u00d71024.

Diffusion models have seen wide success in image generation [1, 2, 3, 4]. Autoregressive models [5], GANs [6, 7] VQ-VAE Transformer based methods [8, 9] have all made remarkable progress in text-to-image research. More recently, Diffusion models have been explored for text-to-image generation [10, 11], including the concurrent work of DALL-E 2 [12]. DALL-E 2 uses a diffusion prior on CLIP latents, and cascaded diffusion models to generate high resolution 1024\u00d71024 images. We believe Imagen is much simpler, as Imagen does not need to learn a latent prior, yet achieves better results in both MS-COCO FID and side-by-side human evaluation on DrawBench. GLIDE [10] also uses cascaded diffusions models for text-to-image, but Imagen uses larger pretrained frozen language models, which we found to be instrumental to both image fidelity and image-text alignment. XMC-GAN [7] also uses BERT as a text encoder, but we scale to much larger text encoders and demonstrate the effectiveness thereof. The use of cascaded diffusion models is also popular throughout the literature [13, 14], and has been used with success in diffusion models to generate high resolution images [2, 3]. Finally, Imagen is part of a series of text-to-image work at Google Research, including its sibling model Parti.                   There are several ethical challenges facing text-to-image research broadly. We offer a more detailed exploration of these challenges in our paper and offer a summarized version here. First, downstream applications of  text-to-image models are varied and may impact society in complex ways. The potential risks of misuse raise concerns regarding responsible open-sourcing of code and demos. At this time we have decided not to release code or a public demo. In future work we will explore a framework for responsible externalization that balances the value of external auditing with the risks of unrestricted open-access.  Second, the data requirements of text-to-image models have led researchers to rely heavily on large, mostly uncurated, web-scraped datasets. While this approach has enabled rapid algorithmic advances in recent years, datasets of this nature often reflect social stereotypes, oppressive viewpoints, and derogatory, or otherwise harmful, associations to marginalized identity groups. While a subset of our training data was filtered to removed noise and undesirable content, such as pornographic imagery and toxic language, we also utilized LAION-400M dataset which is known to contain a wide range of inappropriate content including pornographic imagery, racist slurs, and harmful social stereotypes. Imagen relies on text encoders trained on uncurated web-scale data, and thus inherits the social biases and limitations of large language models. As such, there is a risk that Imagen has encoded harmful stereotypes and representations, which guides our decision to not release Imagen for public use without further safeguards in place.                   Finally, while there has been extensive work auditing image-to-text and image labeling models for forms of social bias, there has been comparatively less work on social bias evaluation methods for text-to-image models. A conceptual vocabulary around potential harms of text-to-image models and established metrics of evaluation are an essential component of establishing responsible model release practices. While we leave an in-depth empirical analysis of social and cultural biases to future work, our small scale internal assessments reveal several limitations that guide our decision not to release our model at this time. \u00a0Imagen, may run into danger of dropping modes of the data distribution, which may further compound the social consequence of dataset bias. Imagen exhibits serious limitations when generating images depicting people. Our human evaluations found Imagen obtains significantly higher preference rates when evaluated on images that do not portray people, indicating \u00a0a degradation in image fidelity. Preliminary assessment also suggests Imagen encodes several social biases and stereotypes, including an overall bias towards generating images of people with lighter skin tones and a tendency for images portraying different professions to align with Western gender stereotypes. Finally, even when we focus generations away from people, our preliminary analysis indicates Imagen encodes a range of social and cultural biases when generating images of activities, events, and objects. We aim to make progress on several of these open challenges and limitations in future work.
