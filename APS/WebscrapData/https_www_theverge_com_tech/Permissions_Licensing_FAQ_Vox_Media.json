Please note: these guidelines are for editorial content only. For information on how we provide disclosures for Advertising Content, please review our Editorial Ethics & Guidelines.   There are several ways you can share our content that does not require a license or permission from us. For example:  Vox Media publishes an array of original work in audio, video, and written formats.
