{"title": "This free TV comes with two screens - The Verge", "content": "By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  There\u2019s a new type of TV coming for Samsung, LG, and Vizio, and it\u2019s completely free if you don\u2019t count the price of your attention \u2014 or data. Telly, a company created by Pluto TV co-founder Ilya Pozin, offers up a TV that makes up for its nonexistent price tag by showing constant advertisements in a second, smaller display. The company calls this thin strip of a screen a \u201cSmart Display,\u201d which is separated from the main TV by a soundbar. In addition to showing ads, it\u2019s also capable of displaying a variety of widgets, including sports scores, a news ticker, the weather, and stock prices. Ads could pop up on the far right side of the Smart Display, as shown in the pictures embedded in this article, but might also appear in the form of a sponsored news feed on the left side of the screen. Janko Roettgers first reported on rumors of the device earlier this month. 1/4 1/4 \u201cWhen I co-founded Pluto TV, we created an entirely new model that offered amazing TV content to viewers for free,\u201d Pozin says in a statement. \u201cNow, with Telly, we are providing the actual television for free as well.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 While ads shouldn\u2019t interrupt whatever you\u2019re watching on the main display, Telly\u2019s chief strategy officer, Dallas Lawrence, tells The Verge that ads might utilize both displays when you\u2019re not using the TV. \u201cWhen the Theatre display (top screen) is not in use, the ad unit could come to life in a fun way connecting both,\u201d Lawrence says. \u201cThere are literally hundreds of things we are thinking about to create the most engaging ad experience ever.\u201d Lawrence also says that Telly is also working on \u201cTelly Rewards\u201d that will reward users with a gift card to services like Netflix or Starbucks for participating in things like on-screen polls. As for the main display, it\u2019s a 55-inch 4K HDR panel linked to the secondary display through the company\u2019s operating system: TellyOS. Unlike most mainline smart TV operating systems, TellyOS currently doesn\u2019t support third-party streaming apps like Netflix. That\u2019s why Telly comes bundled with a free 4K Android TV dongle that you can use to watch whatever streaming service you want. It\u2019s also compatible with other streaming devices, including Roku, the Amazon Fire Stick, and Apple TV, and has three HDMI inputs, 2 USB inputs, and a tuner that you can use to watch over-the-air broadcasts. There\u2019s more to the TV than just the two displays, though. If you look closely, you might notice a camera that\u2019s planted smack-dab in the middle of the soundbar. That enables \u201cfree advanced motion-tracking fitness programs\u201d that come with the TV, along with the Zoom integration that Telly\u2019s launching with as well. Lawrence tells The Verge that the TV comes with a privacy shutter (and that the TV ships with it shut), so you can open and close it as you please.  Equipped with a camera and microphone and paid for by the brands that show you ads, having a Telly in your home has clear privacy implications that might go beyond the tracking used by Vizio, Roku, LG, Samsung, and other TV manufacturers. On its viewing and activity data policy, Telly says it \u201cmay collect information about the audio and video content you watch, the channels you view, and the duration of your viewing sessions,\u201d along with information about \u201chow you interact\u201d with the TV. That includes your search queries, the buttons you select, as well as the \u201cphysical presence of you and any other individuals using the TV at any given time.\u201d Oh, and if you choose to opt out of data collection, you\u2019ll either have to return the TV or pay the presumed cost of the dual-screen TV plus soundbar setup yourself: You have the right to opt-out of sharing your Viewing and Activity Data, but unfortunately, that means you will no longer have access to the Services [and must return the television]. If you opt out and do not return the television to Telly, Telly will charge the credit card on file in the amount of $500.00. Telly is also shipping with 40 different games and the ability to play music from \u201cpopular music services.\u201d It even has an \u201cAI-driven voice assistant\u201d that answers to \u201cHey Telly,\u201d allowing you to set timers or snooze an alarm. If all that sounds a bit vague, that\u2019s because it is. The company has yet to reveal the music services it's partnering with and didn\u2019t expand much on the games or the AI assistant that the device will feature. Still, all points to Pozin\u2019s massive goals for Telly. Pozin has made a bet on free TV in the past with the launch of Pluto TV, one of the most successful free ad-supported streaming TV services (FAST), and will likely apply this knowledge to free hardware as well.  \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by the free price,\u201d Pozin says in a statement. \u201cThis is by far the most advanced television ever developed.\u201d  Would I take a free, ad-supported TV over the LG I have now? Absolutely not, but I\u2019m genuinely intrigued with how this setup works. You can visit the freetelly.com website to reserve one of the 500,000 free devices that Telly says will start shipping \u201cthis summer.\u201d Update, May 15th 8:38AM ET: Updated to add more information on Telly\u2019s privacy policies.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.
