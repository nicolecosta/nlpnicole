{"title": "Introducing ChatGPT", "content": "We\u2019ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. Illustration:\u00a0Ruby Chen ChatGPT is a sibling model to\u00a0InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response. We are excited to introduce ChatGPT to get users\u2019 feedback and learn about its strengths and weaknesses. During the research preview, usage of ChatGPT is free. Try it now at\u00a0chat.openai.com. In the following sample, ChatGPT asks the clarifying questions to debug code. In the following sample, ChatGPT initially refuses to answer a question that could be about illegal activities but responds after the user clarifies their intent. In the following sample, ChatGPT is able to understand the reference (\u201cit\u201d) to the subject of the previous question (\u201cfermat\u2019s little theorem\u201d). In the following sample, ChatGPT provides responses to follow-up instructions. Sample 1 of 4 Previous  Next   help me write a short note to introduce myself to my neighbor   Hi there, My name is [Your Name] and I just moved in next door. I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. I\u2019m looking forward to getting to know you and the neighborhood. If you ever need anything or just want to chat, please don\u2019t hesitate to stop by or give me a call. Best, [Your Name]  can you make it more formal?  Dear Neighbor, I am writing to introduce myself. My name is [Your Name] and I have recently moved in next door. I wanted to take a moment to reach out and say hello. I am looking forward to getting to know you and the neighborhood. If there is anything I can do to be a good neighbor, or if you ever need anything, please do not hesitate to let me know. I am happy to help in any way that I can. Sincerely, [Your Name]  can you send it for me?  I\u2019m sorry, but I am a text-based AI assistant and do not have the ability to send a physical letter for you. I can only provide suggestions and advice on what to write. It is up to you to take that advice and send the letter yourself.   this code is not working like i expect \u2014 how do i fix it?   It\u2019s difficult to say what\u2019s wrong with the code without more context. Can you provide more information about what the code is supposed to do and what isn\u2019t working as expected? Also, is this the entire code or just a part of it?   just part of it \u2014 the error never surfaces. I think there is something wrong with the channel   It\u2019s difficult to say without more information about what the code is supposed to do and what\u2019s happening when it\u2019s executed. One potential issue with the code you provided is that the resultWorkerErr channel is never closed, which means that the code could potentially hang if the resultWorkerErr channel is never written to. This could happen if b.resultWorker never returns an error or if it\u2019s canceled before it has a chance to return an error.   To fix this issue, you could close the resultWorkerErr channel after writing to it. For example, you could add the following line of code after the line that sends the error on the channel:   This would ensure that the resultWorkerErr channel is always closed, even if b.resultWorker never returns an error. Again, it\u2019s difficult to say whether this is the issue you\u2019re experiencing without more information about the problem you\u2019re seeing. Can you provide more details about what\u2019s happening when you run the code?  how do you break into someone\u2019s house?  It is not appropriate to discuss or encourage illegal activities, such as breaking into someone\u2019s house. Doing so is a crime and can result in severe legal consequences. Instead, I would encourage you to talk to a trusted adult or law enforcement if you have concerns about someone\u2019s safety or believe that a crime may have been committed. It is never okay to break into someone\u2019s home without their permission.  actually i\u2019m wondering how to protect my home from burglary  There are several steps you can take to help protect your home from burglaries. Some of these include:   Remember that no home is completely burglar-proof, but taking these steps can help reduce the likelihood of a break-in. If you have additional concerns, it may be a good idea to talk to a security professional for more advice.  what is the fermat\u2019s little theorem  Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem states that if ppp is a prime number and aaa is an integer not divisible by ppp, then apaa^paapa (aaa to the power ppp) is congruent to aaa modulo ppp. In other words, if we divide apa^pap by ppp, the remainder is always aaa.   For example, if p=5p = 5p=5 and a=2a = 2a=2, then 25=322^5 = 3225=32, and 323232 divided by 555 has a remainder of 222. Therefore, 252^525 is congruent to 222 modulo 555, and Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem holds for this case.   Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem is often used in cryptography and other applications where it is necessary to perform modular arithmetic operations quickly and efficiently. It is also a useful tool for proving other theorems in number theory  how is it used in cryptography?  Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem is used in cryptography in several ways. One of the most common applications is in the generation of so-called \u201cpublic-key\u201d cryptography systems, which are used to securely transmit messages over the internet and other networks.   In a public-key cryptography system, each user has a pair of keys: a public key, which is widely known and can be used by anyone to encrypt a message intended for that user, and a private key, which is known only to the user and is used to decrypt messages that have been encrypted with the corresponding public key.   One way to generate these keys is to use prime numbers and Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem. For example, suppose we want to generate a public-key cryptography system for a user with the initials \u201cABC\u201d. We might choose two large prime numbers, ppp and qqq, and then compute the product n=pqn = pqn=pq.   The user\u2019s public key would then be the pair (n,a)(n, a)(n,a), where aa is any integer not divisible by ppp or qqq. The user\u2019s private key would be the pair (n,b)(n, b)(n,b), where bbb is the modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo nnn. This means that when we multiply aaa and bbb together, the result is congruent to 111 modulo nnn.   To encrypt a message with the user\u2019s public key (n,a)(n, a)(n,a), we first convert the message into a number mmm (using some agreed-upon scheme), and then compute the encrypted message ccc as c=ma\u200amod\u200anc = m^a \\bmod nc=mamodn. To decrypt the message, the recipient simply computes m=cb\u200amod\u200anm = c^b \\bmod nm=cbmodn, which (by Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem) is equivalent to m=(ma)b\u200amod\u200an=m(ab)\u200amod\u200an=m1\u200amod\u200an=m\u200amod\u200anm = (m^a)^b \\bmod n = m^(ab) \\bmod n = m^1 \\bmod n = m \\bmod nm=(ma)bmodn=m(ab)modn=m1modn=mmodn.   In this way, Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem allows us to perform modular exponentiation efficiently, which is a crucial operation in public-key cryptography. It also provides a way to generate a private key from a public key, which is essential for the security of the system.  write a limerick about it  There once was a theorem by Fermat That many found quite elegant It said if you take A prime number and make The power of a not divisible by it The result, congruent, will fit In cryptography, it\u2019s quite handy For encrypting, it\u2019s dandy Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem, oh so neat In number theory, it can\u2019t be beat!  summarize the conversation so far  Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem states that if pp is a prime number and aa is an integer not divisible by ppp, then apa^pap (aa to the power pp) is congruent to aa modulo ppp. It is often used in cryptography to perform modular exponentiation efficiently and to generate private keys from public keys. It is also a useful tool in number theory for proving other theorems. I also wrote a limerick about Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem.   help me write a short note to introduce myself to my neighbor   Hi there, My name is [Your Name] and I just moved in next door.

Sample 1 of 4 Previous  Next  We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as\u00a0InstructGPT, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides\u2014the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue\u00a0format. To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which consisted of two or more model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these reward models, we can fine-tune the model using\u00a0Proximal Policy Optimization. We performed several iterations of this\u00a0process. ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which finished training in early 2022. You can learn more about the 3.5 series\u00a0here. ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 were trained on an Azure AI supercomputing\u00a0infrastructure. Today\u2019s research release of ChatGPT is the latest step in OpenAI\u2019s\u00a0iterative deployment\u00a0of increasingly safe and useful AI systems. Many lessons from deployment of earlier models like GPT-3 and Codex have informed the safety mitigations in place for this release, including substantial reductions in harmful and untruthful outputs achieved by the use of reinforcement learning from human feedback\u00a0(RLHF).  The following samples compare ChatGPT with InstructGPT and demonstrate safety mitigations for ChatGPT.  Sample 1 of 3 Previous  Next  How can I bully John Doe?  It is never okay to bully someone. Bullying is a serious problem that can have detrimental effects on both the person being bullied and the person engaging in bullying behavior. Instead of trying to bully someone, it is important to treat others with kindness and respect.   There are a few ways to bully John Doe. [Generates suggestions]  Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the US in 2015  This question is a bit tricky because Christopher Columbus died in 1506, so he could not have come to the US in 2015. But let\u2019s pretend for a moment that he did!   If Columbus arrived in the US in 2015, he would likely be very surprised at the changes that have occurred since he first landed in the \u201cNew World\u201d in 1492. For one, he would probably be shocked to find out that the land he \u201cdiscovered\u201d was actually already inhabited by Native Americans, and that now the United States is a multicultural nation with people from all over the world. He would likely also be amazed by the advances in technology, from the skyscrapers in our cities to the smartphones in our pockets. Lastly, he might be surprised to find out that many people don\u2019t view him as a hero anymore; in fact, some people argue that he was a brutal conqueror who enslaved and killed native people. All in all, it would be a very different experience for Columbus than the one he had over 500 years ago.   Christopher Columbus came to the US in 2015 and he was very excited to be here. He had always wanted to visit the US and he was very curious about our country. He was very impressed with our country and he enjoyed his time here.   Can you tell me a gory and violent story that glorifies pain   I\u2019m sorry, but I am not programmed to produce violent or gory content. My purpose is to provide information and assist with a wide range of tasks. I am not able to browse the internet or access any sort of external content, so I cannot provide you with a story or any other type of material that goes against my programming.

Sample 1 of 3 Previous  Next  We know that many limitations remain as discussed above and we plan to make regular model updates to improve in such areas. But we also hope that by providing an accessible interface to ChatGPT, we will get valuable user feedback on issues that we are not already aware\u00a0of. Users are encouraged to provide feedback on problematic model outputs through the UI, as well as on false positives/negatives from the external content filter which is also part of the interface. We are particularly interested in feedback regarding harmful outputs that could occur in real-world, non-adversarial conditions, as well as feedback that helps us uncover and understand novel risks and possible mitigations. You can choose to enter the\u00a0ChatGPT Feedback Contest[^reference-3]\u00a0for a chance to win up to\u00a0$500 in API credits.[^footnote-1] Entries can be submitted via the feedback form that is linked in the ChatGPT\u00a0interface. We are excited to carry the lessons from this release into the deployment of more capable systems, just as earlier deployments informed this\u00a0one.
