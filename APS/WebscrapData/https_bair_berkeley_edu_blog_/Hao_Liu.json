{"title": "Hao Liu", "content": "           I am a fourth-year PhD student of Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by Pieter Abbeel. I am interested in finding scalable computational solutions to achieve interactive machine intelligence.                   The central focus of my research involves the development of techniques for facilitating the acquisition of knowledge by neural networks through their interactions with the environment, this includes unsupervised exploration, multimodal understanding, integration with human and automated feedback, and other related concepts.
