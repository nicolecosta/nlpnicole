{"title": "Sergey Levine", "content": "I am an Associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley. In my research, I focus on algorithms that can enable autonomous agents to acquire complex behaviors through learning, especially general-purpose methods that could enable any autonomous system to learn to solve any task. Applications of such methods include robotics, as well as a range of other domains that require autonomous decision making.To see a more formal biography, click here. Sergey Levine received a BS and MS in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2009, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2014. He joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley in fall 2016. His work focuses on machine learning for decision making and control, with an emphasis on deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms. Applications of his work include autonomous robots and vehicles, as well as applications in other decision-making domains. His research includes developing algorithms for end-to-end training of deep neural network policies that combine perception and control, scalable algorithms for inverse reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning algorithms, and more. These talks summarize some recent research in RAIL, as well as perspectives on problems in robotics, reinforcement learning, and AI more broadly. Below I provide links to videos and course material on reinforcement learning and deep learning.", "url": "https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/", "threshold": 0.3757098572785649}
