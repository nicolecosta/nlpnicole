You can see them in use in end-user devices (through face recognition for unlocking smartphones) or for detecting credit card fraud (like triggering alerts for unusual purchases). Within artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, there are two basic approaches: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The main difference is one uses labeled data to help predict outcomes, while the other does not. However, there are some nuances between the two approaches, and key areas in which one outperforms the other. This post will clarify the differences so you can choose the best approach for your situation. Supervised learning is a machine learning approach that\u2019s defined by its use of labeled datasets. These datasets are designed to train or \u201csupervise\u201d algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. Using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time. Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data mining: classification and regression: Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention (hence, they are \u201cunsupervised\u201d). Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering, association and dimensionality reduction: The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not. In supervised learning, the algorithm \u201clearns\u201d from the training dataset by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can predict how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather conditions and so on. But first, you\u2019ll have to train it to know that rainy weather extends the driving time. Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data. Note that they still require some human intervention for validating output variables. For example, an unsupervised learning model can identify that online shoppers often purchase groups of products at the same time. However, a data analyst would need to validate that it makes sense for a recommendation engine to group baby clothes with an order of diapers, applesauce and sippy cups. Choosing the right approach for your situation depends on how your data scientists assess the structure and volume of your data, as well as the use case. To make your decision, be sure to do the following: Classifying big data can be a real challenge in supervised learning, but the results are highly accurate and trustworthy. In contrast, unsupervised learning can handle large volumes of data in real time. But, there\u2019s a lack of transparency into how data is clustered and a higher risk of inaccurate results. This is where semi-supervised learning comes in. Can\u2019t decide on whether to use supervised or unsupervised learning? Semi-supervised learning is a happy medium, where you use a training dataset with both labeled and unlabeled data. It\u2019s particularly useful when it\u2019s difficult to extract relevant features from data \u2014 and when you have a high volume of data. Semi-supervised learning is ideal for medical images, where a small amount of training data can lead to a significant improvement in accuracy. For example, a radiologist can label a small subset of CT scans for tumors or diseases so the machine can more accurately predict which patients might require more medical attention. Machine learning models are a powerful way to gain the data insights that improve our world.
