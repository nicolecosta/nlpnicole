{"title": "F1: A Distributed SQL Database That Scales \u2013 Google Research", "content": "F1 is a distributed relational database system built atGoogle to support the AdWords business. F1 is a hybriddatabase that combines high availability, the scalability ofNoSQL systems like Bigtable, and the consistency and usability of traditional SQL databases. F1 is built on Spanner, which provides synchronous cross-datacenter replication and strong consistency. Synchronous replication implies higher commit latency, but we mitigate that latencyby using a hierarchical schema model with structured datatypes and through smart application design. F1 also includes a fully functional distributed SQL query engine andautomatic change tracking and publishing. We maintain a portfolio of research projects, providing individuals and teams the freedom to emphasize specific types of work", "url": "https://research.google.com/pubs/pub41344.html", "threshold": 0.7987802966164423}
