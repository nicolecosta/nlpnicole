{"title": "Going Deeper with Convolutions \u2013 Google Research", "content": "We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed Inception that achieves the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC2014). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation of this architecture, GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, was used to assess its quality in the context of object detection and classification. We maintain a portfolio of research projects, providing individuals and teams the freedom to emphasize specific types of work", "url": "https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43022.html", "threshold": 0.6360807297767723}
