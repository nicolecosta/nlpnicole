{"title": "Outreach \u2013 Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory", "content": "As the field of AI continues to make a bigger impact in the world, researchers and educators at SAIL believe that to develop the most inclusive, humanistic, and benevolent technologies, it is imperative that the field of AI includes students, researchers, and technologists from all walks of life. With this mission in mind, SAILORS (short for the \u201cStanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\u2019s Outreach Summer Program\u201d) was created in 2015 to expose high school students in underrepresented populations to the field of artificial intelligence. This program has since been renamed to Stanford AI4ALL, signaling a partnership between SAIL and education non-profit AI4ALL. This annual summer program is built upon the hypothesis that to increase diversity representation in the field of AI, CS, and STEM at large, it is critical to introduce the technology along with its humanistic mission statements. And in turn, the long-term vision for AI and STEM is for the fields to train a more diverse generation of technologists who have humanistic goals in mind when designing next-generation technologies. SAIL and HAI offer Stanford AI4ALL, a three-week online program for young students in grade 9 that aims to increase diversity in computer science. This year program is co-organized by the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), but with a new, updated curriculum developed by AI4ALL, a nonprofit organization dedicated to training the next generation of AI researchers. Both SAILORS and AI4ALL were founded by Dr. Fei-Fei Li (Stanford University) and Dr. Olga Russakovsky (Princeton University), two world-renowned AI researchers dedicated to expanding access to their field. Stanford AI4ALL Application Information Stanford AI4ALL seeks motivated young and eager students in 9th grade (raising 10th graders during the summer) to participate in a life-changing, three-week online summer program. For application details, follow the link below. 2022: Camp dates June 27- July 15, 2022 Financial aid is available.  The aim of the Logic for All project is to bring Logic education to secondary schools across the country. \u00a0Our work on this project includes research on the foundations of logic, the development of innovative educational materials and educational technology, and the use of these innovations in traditional courses, MOOCs, and summer camps for high school students and high school teachers.\u00a0 For more information, please visit\u00a0 http://intrologic.stanford.edu.
