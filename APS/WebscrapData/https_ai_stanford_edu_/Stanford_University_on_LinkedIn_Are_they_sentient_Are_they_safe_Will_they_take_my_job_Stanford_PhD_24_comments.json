Stanford PhD student Eric Mitchell answers the internet\u2019s questions on AI chatbots \ud83d\udc47 Head - Data Engineering, Quality, Operations  Why would anyone take a student and make him appear like he is a magician speaking to toddlers in a birthday party? Why can't a professor address the true difference between sentience and passing or close to passing the Turing test? Why can't the serious issue of misinformation be put into this context?And why is this person using Google to demonstrate an argument for which anyone would use chatGPT ui?The entire group in Stanford posting this should feel ashamed of belittling and condescending people in this manner. No one is stupid and dumb, if you want to explain something present your arguments in a respectable manner   ChatGPT DOES now access internet so he said in error they are not. They have these plug ins now. So they are not just recalling from their memory, but can search the internet for actual info and quotes etc. Also these plug ins write code now too. Wish he answered the question posed on what is the cap if any on what ChatGPT can do when on internet and writing code, or will it have freedom to modify internet or write new propaganda code? What type of oversight is or will there be to stop this and also the AI advancing itself to whatever it wants? But overall... nice questions and answers to better understand capabilities and uses of ChatGPT. Thanks for your time and efforts! Expert Director \"Intelligence, Analytics & Big Data\" at Devoteam | Innovative Tech  1. AI comprises more than large language models.2. Hallucinations are still a major challenge with such models.3. ChatGPT is a wonderful example for \"computers are not intelligent, they only think they are\".In a way, ChatGPT is already quite human-like: it doesn't have a clue about the world, but a lot of that - and it keeps talking...Don't get me wrong - this technology does have fascinating applications - it's just not the panacea some people perceive it as. Shareholder at Parfums Christian Dior  Cool Data Engineering @ NatWest Group  Quite an interesting yet simple explanation of LLMs as an aggregated average of all the opinions! Accounting ~ Taxes ~ Analytics ~ SAS ~ Mathematics ~ Applied Statistics  Perhaps meta-sentient... Student at Shanti Bhavan   I definitely learned something about how curious people get when it comes to ChatGpt and the internet. Thank You for answering some of my curiousity! Lecturer  Interesting to explore.... Shareholder  Great video. Thank you for sharing.

Prof. Hinton is one of the deep learning pioneers whose discoveries underlie today's powerful systems such as #chatgpt\u00a0and\u00a0#bardai. Out of the trio of Turing Award laureates for deep learning in 2018, two are now voicing concerns (Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio). The third laureate, Yann LeCun (who works for Meta), remains highly optimistic.https://lnkd.in/dkzAwM-J (NY Times article)https://lnkd.in/dZYe9C3a (MIT Technology Review article)In hindsight, prof. Hinton's uneasiness was evident a month ago in the interview for CBS:https://lnkd.in/dQNevfaT#ai #aisafety #google #aiethics #aipolicy #aigovernance #responsibleai        To view or add a comment, sign in                 Entrepreneur, Author, Forbes Contributor, and Speaker              Has anyone been laid-off due to clear AI applications or uses?

What if we each had our own personal intelligence (Pi) to cultivate and amplify our better selves?Today, my co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder Kar\u00e9n Simonyan and the Inflection AI team present Pi, a kind, supportive personal AI that\u2019s in your corner and is always calibrating to your needs. Of course, safety is a top priority at Inflection. New technologies that we bring into our lives should be safe, trustworthy, and reliable.

He is not a random AI fatalist and I think that on the past few months all hells broke loose on the new AI race and a lot of safety mechanisms that companies used were dumped in order to not lose the AI race.We didn't even begin to scratch the surface of applications and (unfortunately) possible dangers of GPT4 and companies are already working on bigger and stronger models.I'm not implying we should stop AI development but security, social and economic impacts must be discussed much more seriously       To view or add a comment, sign in                 Performance Marketer | Growth Hacker | Digital Marketer | Brand Builder              Just Blown away by \"AI\"This is how searching with AI tools looks Put in your questions and ...You get an instant reply.Just like asking a genie as in the fairytalesYou can look for variations or expand further on the results.Technology makes our life much easier.Have you tried this? \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb#marketingautomation #ai #digitalamarketing #chatgpt #technology #onlinemarketing       To view or add a comment, sign in                 AI Model Validation | Model Risk Management | Responsible AI               Back propagation of errors while training a Neural Network #machinelearning #neuralnetworks #ai #deeplearning       To view or add a comment, sign in             1,207,814 followers           ", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stanford-university_are-they-sentient-are-they-safe-will-they-activity-7053034334814965760-0lZ8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop", "threshold": 0.9999639749435645}
