{"title": "Four faculty named 2023 Sloan Fellows - Stanford Report", "content": "The fellowship supports early-career researchers in scientific disciplines and technical fields in the United States and Canada. Four Stanford faculty members are among the recipients of 2023 Sloan Research Fellowships, which recognize talented scientists in the United States and Canada. The fellowship is one of the most competitive awards available to early-career scientists and offers $75,000 to help advance their research. This year\u2019s fellows come from 54 institutions, including private and public universities, and small liberal arts colleges. The 2023 Sloan Research Fellows from Stanford are: Jeannette Bohg, assistant professor of computer science at the School of Engineering Zakir Durumeric, assistant professor of computer science at the School of Engineering Chelsea B. Finn, assistant professor of computer science and of electrical engineering at the School of Engineering Alexandra Konings, assistant professor of Earth system science in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability The Sloan Research Fellowship was established in 1955 by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports scientific advancement. A total of 241 Stanford faculty have received the award, including this year\u2019s winners. Each year, more than 1,000 researchers are nominated for 126 awards. Scholars in seven scientific disciplines and technical fields are eligible: chemistry, computer science, Earth system science, economics, mathematics, neuroscience, and physics. Candidates are nominated by fellow scientists and the winners are selected by independent panels of senior scholars based on each candidate\u2019s research accomplishments, creativity, and potential to become a leader in their field. Each year the foundation issues grants in four broad areas: direct support of research in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and economics; initiatives to increase the quality and diversity of scientific institutions and the science workforce; projects to develop or leverage technology to empower research; and efforts to enhance and deepen public engagement with science and scientists.

Thousands are expected to visit campus for Stanford Powwow to celebrate Native American and Indigenous cultures. The award will fund the Stanford biologist\u2019s ongoing study of hybridization, or the exchange of genes between different species. The fund helps provide refuge at Stanford for researchers and academics who have fled persecution or conflict in their home countries so they can safely continue their scholarship.
