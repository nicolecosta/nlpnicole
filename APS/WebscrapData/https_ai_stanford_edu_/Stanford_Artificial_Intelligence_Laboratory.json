{"title": "Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory", "content": "The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) has been a center of excellence for Artificial Intelligence research, teaching, theory, and practice since its founding in 1963. See over eight hours of video from Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory researchers speaking on April 13, 2023. Professor Chelsea Finn and PhD Student Tony Zhao have now introduced a system for fine-grained robotic manipulation that relies on low-cost hardware and imitation learning directly from real demonstrations. Are they sentient? Are they safe? Will they take my job? Stanford PhD student Eric Mitchell answers the internet\u2019s questions on AI chatbots From deepfakes to Bing\u2019s chatbot, AI-generated content is everywhere. Here\u2019s how to spot it. The fellows are \u201cearly-career scholars represent[ing] the most promising scientific researchers working today. Their achievements and potential place them among the next generation of scientific leaders in the U.S. and Canada.\u201d The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab has a rich history which you can learn about in a new video on AI at Stanford from 1962 to 2022. Click \u201cRead More\u201d below to see it. I concur. I have not yet used any AI to help me write and I don\u2019t plan to in the foreseeable future.  The act of starting from a blank page and writing a coherent argument is crucial for our thought processes. If we cede our writing to AI we cede our capacity to think also. If you want your writing to actually have your voice, don\u2019t let AI write for you. This week\u2019s @StanfordEng The Future of Everything podcast is @chrmanning talking with @Rbaltman about human languages and thought, ChatGPT, the rise of LLMs, endangered languages and everything in betweenhttps://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/future-computational-linguisticsPocket Casts: https://pca.st/m9o0jy0q This was quite a week in AI! Google's \"no moat\" leak and amazing new releases by @togethercompute @MosaicML @BigCodeProject  our blog talks about how AI's technical moat is shrinking and why it's good to be optimistic about open source: https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-05-05-ai-moats  At #ICLR2023 we introduce AUTOTRANSFER, the innovative few-shot AutoML solution that rapidly finds an optimal architecture by transferring design knowledge between ML problems. AUTOTRANSFER brings big efficiency improvements by exploring far fewer designs.https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07669  Our ICLR 2023 spotlight paper introduces LAMP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for multi-resolution physics. It optimizes computation cost and resolution for accurate simulation of dynamic regions, with controllable error-computation tradeoff.https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01122  Very excited to share our new #ICML2023 papers\u26a1\ufe0f-new data valuation https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07718-discover-and-cure https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00650-subgroup discovery https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00195-moon-shapes in #ML  https://moonshape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Will discuss key findings of each in upcoming posts!
