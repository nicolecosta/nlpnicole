Led by Professor Chelsea Finn and PhD student Tony Z. Zhao, researchers have now introduced a system for fine-grained robotic manipulation that relies on low-cost hardware and imitation learning directly from real demonstrations. Notably, the imitation learning is strengthened by the team\u2019s novel learning algorithm in which a robot is trained to predict actions in chunks, rather than one at a time. Read the team\u2019s paper and watch many more demos: tonyzhaozh.github.io/alohaVideo courtesy of Tony Z.

The idea is to provide IEEE RAS members a unique educational content, through IEEE TV platform, of advanced topics for which no quality online material is available. This goes very in line with the objectives of our workshop\u00a0\u00a0#icra, #GeometricMethods 4 #robotics \ud83e\udd16At this point, the deadline is approaching (May 04, 2023 - AoE).If you have any ideas, results, or analyses, we invite you to submit an extended abstract paper (2-4 pgs + (extra-pages for references) in IEEE Conf format with 2 columns). For more information and access to the submission platform, please check our website:https://lnkd.in/eXYd_E46Feel free to also contact the organizers: Riddhiman Laha, Tobias L\u00f6w, Sylvain Calinon, Bruno Vilhena Adorno, Nilanjan Chakraborty, Sami Haddadin, and myself.Looking forward to seeing you in London!\u00a0       To view or add a comment, sign in                 Founder & CEO of AiM Medical Robotics, Professor and Director of PracticePoint R&D Center at WPI              We had a very interesting discussion on the future of surgical robotics in our panel \"Beyond General Surgery: The Next Frontiers in Medical Robotics\" at the LSI - Life Science Intelligence\u2122 USA \u201823 meeting.Great insight from fellow panelists Christopher Prentice, Addie H., Bruce Wayne Lichorowic and Stuart Simpson, moderated by Omar M.
