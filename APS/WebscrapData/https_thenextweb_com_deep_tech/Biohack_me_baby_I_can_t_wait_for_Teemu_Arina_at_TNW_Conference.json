I often fantasise about biohacking my useless brain.\u00a0At TNW Conference, my dreams could finally be fulfilled. On day two of the event, biohacker Teemu Arina will immerse attendees in the fascinating realm of human enhancement. Arina is one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on the movement. He co-authored the bestselling Biohacker\u2019s Handbook and founded the Biohacker Summit \u2014 Europe\u2019s leading conference for optimising human performance. He\u2019s also the co-founder of Biohacker Center, an independent think tank that researches peak performance, health, and well-being. Naturally, Arina meticulously biohacks himself. Initially, I imagined this would involve drilling brain chips into his skull. But biohacking is closer to DIY biology. Arina\u2019s website provides a more detailed description: \u201cBiohacking is the art and science of optimizing your body, mind,\u00a0and performance with systems thinking, technology, and biology \u2014\u00a0in other words, better living through science.\u201d Arina entered the field after he was afflicted by a chronic illness. Biohacking provided a route to recovery. That led him to further optimise his health and performance with biological and technological tools. Some of these tools are surprisingly accessible. Arina uses activity trackers to manage stress, a headset to measure brainwaves, a muscle scanner to guide fitness training, and a blue light device to synchronise his circadian rhythm. At TNW Conference on June 16, Arina will unravel the next phase of biohacking \u2014 and how it can unlock human potential. He promises to share his pioneering techniques for enhancing physical and mental performance. To my decrepit mind and body, that sounds like an unmissable offer. And just in case Arina wants to ramp it up, I\u2019m bringing my brain and scalpel. Teemu Arina\u2019s biohacking tips are merely one attraction of TNW Conference.
