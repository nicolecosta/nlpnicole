The EU is edging closer to a landmark ban on predictive policing and facial recognition. At a crunch vote today on the bloc\u2019s flagship AI Act, two committees of MEPs overwhelmingly endorsed sweeping new rules on artificial intelligence. The text now moves to a vote by the entire European Parliament in June. Once approved, the regulation will become the world\u2019s first comprehensive AI law. At Thursday\u2019s vote, MEPs approved a strengthened version of the rulebook. The Act now prohibits predictive policing and facial recognition in public spaces. The amendments also introduce new restrictions on generative models, such as ChatGPT, and emotion recognition. Civil liberties campaigners have welcomed the move. Fair Trials, a criminal justice watchdog, described the vote as \u201ca landmark result\u201d for human rights. \u201cThese systems automate injustice, exacerbating and reinforcing racism and discrimination in policing and the criminal justice system, and feeding systemic inequality in society,\u201d said Griff Ferris, Senior Legal and Policy Officer at Fair Trials. \u201cThe EU Parliament has taken an important step in voting for a ban on these systems, and we urge them to finish the job at the final vote in June.\u201d In the tech sector, reactions to the vote were mixed. The Software Alliance (BSA), a lobby group that represents the likes of Microsoft and IBM, has called for further clarification. \u201cThe enterprise software industry remains concerned about the allocation of responsibilities in the AI\u00a0value chain and the treatment of foundation models,\u201d said Matteo Quattrocchi, BSA\u2019s policy director. \u201cThe rules as currently written are not tailored to reflect companies\u2019 roles in the\u00a0AI\u00a0ecosystem, or differences in business models and\u00a0AI\u00a0uses, and likely will not address some of the concerns raised by specific applications of some foundation models.\u201d Privacy experts, meanwhile, can expect further demand for their services. Isabelle Roccia, MD for Europe at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, anticipates a significant impact. \u201cOrganisations will have to increasingly rely on their privacy teams to operationalize AI because their data stewardship expertise is highly transferrable and extremely relevant to AI governance,\u201d she said.
