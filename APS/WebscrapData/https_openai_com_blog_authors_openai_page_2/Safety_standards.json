{"title": "Safety standards", "content": "In a society where access to generative AI tools will become as essential to access to the internet, we must balance our obligation to mitigate serious risks with allowing diverse values to flourish. We monitor the use of our tools and update safety mitigations based on what we learn about model risks and capabilities, reflecting our leadership in commercial AI deployment. Minimize harmWe will build safety into our AI tools where possible, and work hard to aggressively reduce harms posed by the misuse or abuse of our AI tools. Build trustAlongside our user and developer community, we\u2019ll share the responsibility with of supporting safe, beneficial applications of our technology. Learn and iterateWe will observe and analyze how our models behave and are used and seek input on our approach to safety in order to improve our systems over time. Be a pioneer in trust and safetyWe will support research into the unique trust and safety challenges posed by generative AI, to help improve safety beyond our ecosystem. We\u2019ve created and compiled resources about our safety practices. Here\u2019s how you can uphold trust and safety as you engage with our products.", "url": "https://openai.com/safety-standards", "threshold": 0.9940112942853345}
