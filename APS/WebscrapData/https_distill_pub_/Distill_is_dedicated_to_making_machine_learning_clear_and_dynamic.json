{"title": "Distill is dedicated to making machine learning clear and dynamic", "content": "Devoted to clear explanations, native to the Web. For outstanding work communicating and refining ideas. We are now on an indefinite hiatus. The web is a powerful medium to share new ways of thinking. Over the last few years we\u2019ve seen many imaginative examples of such work. But traditional academic publishing remains focused on the PDF, which prevents this sort of communication. New notations, visualizations, and mental models can deepen our understanding. By nurturing the development of such new ways of thinking, Distill will enable new discoveries. Machine learning will fundamentally change how humans and computers interact.  It\u2019s important to make those techniques transparent, so we can understand and safely control how they work. Distill will provide a platform for vividly illustrating these ideas. Many researchers want to do work that is not easily contained within a PDF, but can\u2019t get the support they need to pursue it. We, as the research community, are failing them by not treating these wonderful, non-traditional research artifacts as \u201creal\u201d academic contributions. When we rush papers out the door to meet conference deadlines, something suffers\u2009\u2014\u2009often it is the readability and clarity of our communication. This can add severe drag to the entire community as our readers struggle to understand our ideas. We think this \u201dresearch debt\u2033 can be avoided.", "url": "https://distill.pub/about/", "threshold": 0.9295319687174735}
