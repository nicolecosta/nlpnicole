From complex interactions between molecules      forming structures such as proteins, to cell colonies achieving global goals like exploration by means of the      individual cells collaborating and communicating, to humans forming collectives in society such as tribes,      governments or countries. The old adage \u201cthe whole is greater than the sum of its parts\u201d, often ascribed to      Aristotle, rings true everywhere we look.           The articles in this thread focus on practical ways of designing self-organizing systems. In particular we use      Differentiable Programming (optimization) to learn agent-level policies that satisfy system-level objectives. The      cross-disciplinary nature of this thread aims to facilitate ideas exchange between ML and developmental biology      communities.           Distill has invited several researchers to publish a \u201cthread\u201d of short articles exploring differentiable      self-organizing systems,      interspersed with critical commentary from several experts in adjacent fields.      The thread will be a living document, with new articles added over time.      Articles and comments are presented below in chronological order:     Alexander Mordvintsev,              Ettore Randazzo,              Eyvind Niklasson,              Michael Levin Google,              Allen Discovery Center           Building their own bodies is the very first skill all living creatures possess. How can we design systems that          grow, maintain and repair themselves by regenerating damages? This work investigates morphogenesis, the          process by which living creatures self-assemble their bodies. It proposes a differentiable, Cellular Automata          model of morphogenesis and shows how such a model learns a robust and persistent set of dynamics to grow any          arbitrary structure starting from a single cell.

The authors show how neural CAs can self-classify the MNIST digit they form. The          resulting CAs can be interacted with by dynamically changing the underlying digit. The CAs respond to          perturbations with a learned self-correcting classification behaviour.

They begin by training NCA          to mimic a series of textures taken from template images. Then, taking inspiration from adversarial          camouflages which appear in nature, they use NCA to create textures which maximally excite neurons in a          pretrained vision model. These results reveal that a simple model combined with well-known objectives can lead          to robust and unexpected behaviors.

MNIST CA can be deceived into outputting incorrect classifications and the patterns in Growing CA can be made to have their shape and colour altered.

The Self-Organizing systems thread is open to articles exploring differentiable self-organizing sytems.      Critical      commentary and discussion of existing articles is also welcome. The thread      is organized through the open #selforg channel on the      Distill slack. Articles can be      suggested there, and will be included at the discretion of previous      authors in the thread, or in the case of disagreement by an uninvolved      editor.           If you would like get involved but don\u2019t know where to start, small      projects may be available if you ask in the channel.           Part of Distill\u2019s mandate is to experiment with new forms of scientific      publishing. We believe that that reconciling faster and more continuous      approaches to publication with review and discussion is an important open      problem in scientific publishing.           Threads are collections of short articles, experiments, and critical      commentary around a narrow or unusual research topic, along with a slack      channel for real time discussion and collaboration. They are intended to      be earlier stage than a full Distill paper, and allow for more fluid      publishing, feedback and discussion. We also hope they\u2019ll allow for wider      participation. Think of a cross between a Twitter thread, an academic      workshop, and a book of collected essays.           Threads are very much an experiment. We think it\u2019s possible they\u2019re a      great format, and also possible they\u2019re terrible. We plan to trial two      such threads and then re-evaluate our thought on the format.           Part of Distill\u2019s mandate is to experiment with new forms of scientific publishing.      We believe something along the lines of this \u201cthread\u201d format might be promising,      but see it very much as an experiment.      We plan to trial two such threads and then re-evaluate our thought on the format.           If you wish to cite this thread as a whole, citation information can be found below.
