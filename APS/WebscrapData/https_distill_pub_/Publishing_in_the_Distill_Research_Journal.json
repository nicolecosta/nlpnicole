{"title": "Publishing in the Distill Research Journal", "content": "Distill is an academic journal in the area of Machine Learning. The distinguishing trait of a Distill article is outstanding communication and a dedication to human understanding. Distill articles often, but not always, use interactive media. One good test for whether your article is a fit for Distill is whether your collaborators and you are willing to put in whatever time is necessary to write and illustrate an outstanding article. In our experience, this often takes 100+ hours. Typically, this means that there is at least one collaborator who is very enthusiastic about explaining things well. Distill is open to publishing a wide range of academic artifacts, provided they meet our editorial standards: The editorial team is especially interested in explorable explanations. Examples: Why Momentum Really Works, Attention and Augmented Recurrent Neural Networks Please discuss intentions with editors@distill.pub prior to submission. Examples: Research Debt Please discuss intentions with editors@distill.pub prior to submission. There are no word count limits for any article type. Articles should be whatever length best serves the reader\u2009\u2014\u2009just be aware that rambling is an easy failure mode. Distill primarily reviews for three things:  This could mean presenting significant novel results, giving a new perspective on known results, or even commentary on public policy. This often, but not always, means that articles will use interactive media. Distill provides the Distill Reviewer Worksheet to help evaluate articles. Reviewers and authors alike are encouraged to refer to this worksheet, be it for self-evaluation or during the review process.  In order for Distill to best serve the community, and to create a respected space for non-traditional contributions, it\u2019s critical for Distill to hold high publication standards. Unfortunately, this means many articles have to be rejected, including good articles that may be publishable elsewhere. Distill articles are prepared in HTML using the Distill infrastructure\u2009\u2014\u2009see the  getting started guide for details. The infrastructure provides nice default styling and standard academic features while preserving the flexibility of the web. Distill articles must be released under the Creative Commons Attribution license. Distill is a primary publication and will not publish content which is identical or substantially similar to content published elsewhere. To submit an article, first create a GitHub repository for your article.1 You can keep it private during the review process if you would like\u2009\u2014\u2009just share your repository with @distillpub-reviewers. Then email editors@distill.pub to begin the process. Distill handles all reviews and editing through GitHub issues. Upon publication, the repository is made public and transferred to the @distillpub organization for preservation. This means that reviews of published work are always public. It is at the author\u2019s discretion whether they share reviews of unpublished work. Distill only considers complete article submissions and evaluates them as is. The first two stages of review are led by an editor. The editor will bring in external peer reviewers based on their discretion as to what perspectives are needed, optimizing for high-quality review and an excellent review experience for all parties. The amount of time these stages take is highly variable depending on how responsive the authors are. For all publications, Distill will review for outstanding communication and design, in addition to scientific quality and integrity. Our reviewing criteria are more explicitly described in the Distill Reviewer Worksheet, which will be used by external reviewers to evaluate a submission. We recommend authors also spend some time using it to self-evaluate and identify areas for improvement.   In the third stage of review, readers can raise new concerns through GitHub issues. The issues will be moderated by Distill\u2019s moderators. Significant issues may be displayed in the article margin if the author does not address them. Distill may occasionally publish editorials, commentary, and invited content without peer review. This content will be clearly marked. The hiatus and the motivations behind it were announced on Distill\u2019s front page. These changes were anounced on Distill\u2019s front page and you can view the prior version of our policy here. Distill may occasionally publish revised versions of this policy. When the review policy changes significantly, the revision will be anounced in an editorial update on Distill\u2019s front page. Distill editors cannot be involved in the review process for a paper on which they are an author or where they are unable to be objective. In the event of a conflict of interest, Distill editors will select a member of the research community to serve as a temporary \u201cacting editor\u201d for an article. The acting editor should be a member of the relevant research community, and at arm\u2019s length to the authors. The use and identity of an acting editor will be noted in the review process log, and made public if the article is published. Machine learning is a small field and Distill\u2019s editors will inevitably have prior relationships with some authors. Such relationships must be disclosed in the review process. In order for Distill to be effective in legitimizing non-traditional publishing, it must be perceived as a primary academic publication. This means it\u2019s important for Distill to follow typical \u201cdual publication\u201d norms. It\u2019s also important for us to avoid the perception that Distill is an \u201caccompanying blog post\u201d for something like an arXiv paper. The result is that Distill can only consider articles that are substantially different from those formally published elsewhere, and is cautious of articles informally published elsewhere. Below Distill provides guidance for particular cases: If you have any concern, please email ethics@distill.pub. You can also reach out to Distill\u2019s editors or steering committee members individually if that feels more comfortable. Distill is still establishing policies and procedures. As issues arise, Distill will consult with the community and give consideration to the policies of journals the editorial team respects (eg. PLOS), the recommendations of the Committee on Publication Ethics, community norms, and the philosophy of the Open Science movement. Distill uses the following evaluation process for potential editors: Being a Distill editor means taking on ownership and responsibility for the success of Distill and for publication decisions within your subject matter portfolio. Distill editors are volunteer positions with no compensation\u2009\u2014\u2009except playing a critical role in advancing a new kind of scientific publishing. In the long-run, the editorial team believes Distill should be open to expanding to other disciplines, with new editors taking on different topic portfolios. In considering editors for new topics, Distill has the same expectations it has for all editors with two modifications:", "url": "https://distill.pub/journal/", "threshold": 0.7025422825615786}
