{"title": "Games News, Trends, Reviews, & More | Mashable", "content": "Games are a form of interactive entertainment that can be enjoyed as a solo activity or with other people. These can range from card games like poker all the way to tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons or video games like Call of Duty or mobile games like Wordle. While games as a concept have existed for thousands of years, today the term \u201cgames\u201d is most commonly used to refer to the types of games listed above. Video games are most commonly played on home consoles like a PlayStation or Xbox, on a personal computer, or on a smartphone. They can come in many forms, such as large commercial products like Grand Theft Auto or small, independent projects that are vehicles for artistic expression. Single player games often tell stories and can last anywhere from a few hours to more than 100 hours. Games that involve more than one person, or multiplayer games, are incredibly popular. These can be played cooperatively or competitively, depending on the game. Most play multiplayer games casually for recreation, but some play them professionally at a high level in tournaments that are broadcast online or, in some cases, on TV.", "url": "https://mashable.com/category/games", "threshold": 0.9385864958882688}
