{"title": "OpenAI Charter", "content": "Our Charter describes the principles we use to execute on OpenAI\u2019s mission. This document reflects the strategy we\u2019ve refined over the past two years, including feedback from many people internal and external to OpenAI. The timeline to AGI remains uncertain, but our Charter will guide us in acting in the best interests of humanity throughout its development. OpenAI\u2019s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\u2014benefits all of humanity. We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome. To that end, we commit to the following\u00a0principles: We commit to use any influence we obtain over AGI\u2019s deployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all, and to avoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate\u00a0power. Our primary fiduciary duty is to humanity. We anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to fulfill our mission, but will always diligently act to minimize conflicts of interest among our employees and stakeholders that could compromise broad\u00a0benefit. We are committed to doing the research required to make AGI safe, and to driving the broad adoption of such research across the AI\u00a0community. We are concerned about late-stage AGI development becoming a competitive race without time for adequate safety precautions. Therefore, if a value-aligned, safety-conscious project comes close to building AGI before we do, we commit to stop competing with and start assisting this project. We will work out specifics in case-by-case agreements, but a typical triggering condition might be \u201ca better-than-even chance of success in the next two\u00a0years.\u201d To be effective at addressing AGI\u2019s impact on society, OpenAI must be on the cutting edge of AI capabilities\u2014policy and safety advocacy alone would be\u00a0insufficient. We believe that AI will have broad societal impact before AGI, and we\u2019ll strive to lead in those areas that are directly aligned with our mission and\u00a0expertise. We will actively cooperate with other research and policy institutions; we seek to create a global community working together to address AGI\u2019s global\u00a0challenges. We are committed to providing public goods that help society navigate the path to AGI. Today this includes publishing most of our AI research, but we expect that safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future, while increasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards\u00a0research.
