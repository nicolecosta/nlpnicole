{"title": "GPT-4", "content": "GPT-4 can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general knowledge and problem solving abilities. GPT-4 is more creative and collaborative than ever before. It can generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user\u2019s writing style. GPT-4 can accept images as inputs and generate captions, classifications, and analyses.  GPT-4 is capable of handling over 25,000 words of text, allowing for use cases like long form content creation, extended conversations, and document search and analysis. ChatGPT GPT-4 ChatGPT GPT-4 (with vision) Following the research path from GPT, GPT-2, and GPT-3, our deep learning approach leverages more data and more computation to create increasingly sophisticated and capable language models. We spent 6 months making GPT-4 safer and more aligned. GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 on our internal evaluations. Training with human feedbackWe incorporated more human feedback, including feedback submitted by ChatGPT users, to improve GPT-4\u2019s behavior. We also worked with over 50 experts for early feedback in domains including AI safety and security.Continuous improvement from real-world useWe\u2019ve applied lessons from real-world use of our previous models into GPT-4\u2019s safety research and monitoring system. Like ChatGPT, we\u2019ll be updating and improving GPT-4 at a regular cadence as more people use it. GPT-4-assisted safety researchGPT-4\u2019s advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities expedited our safety work. We used GPT-4 to help create training data for model fine-tuning and iterate on classifiers across training, evaluations, and monitoring. We\u2019ve collaborated with organizations building innovative products with GPT-4. We\u2019re excited to see how people use GPT-4 as we work towards developing technologies that empower everyone.", "url": "https://openai.com/product/gpt-4", "threshold": 0.8993122461066363}
