DALL\u00b7E 2 can create original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles. DALL\u00b7E 2 can create original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles. DALL\u00b7E 2 can expand images beyond what\u2019s in the original canvas, creating expansive new compositions. DALL\u00b7E 2 can make realistic edits to existing images from a natural language caption. It can add and remove elements while taking shadows, reflections, and textures into\u00a0account. DALL\u00b7E 2 can take an image and create different variations of it inspired by the original. In January 2021, OpenAI introduced DALL\u00b7E. One year later, our newest system, DALL\u00b7E 2, generates more realistic and accurate images with 4x greater resolution. DALL\u00b7E 1 DALL\u00b7E 2 preferred for caption matching preferred for photorealism Our hope is that DALL\u00b7E 2 will empower people to express themselves creatively. DALL\u00b7E 2 also helps us understand how advanced AI systems see and understand our world, which is critical to our mission of creating AI that benefits humanity.
