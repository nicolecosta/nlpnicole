{"title": "Google wants robots to generate their own code | TechCrunch", "content": "There are countless big problems left to solve in the world of automation, and robotic learning sits somewhere near the top. While it\u2019s true that humans have gotten pretty good at programming systems for specific tasks, there\u2019s a big, open-ended question of: and then what? New research demonstrated at Google\u2019s AI event in New York City this morning proposes the notion of letting robotic systems effectively write their own code. The concept is designed to save human developers the hassle of having to go in and reprogram things as new information arises.

All of that work can prove foundational in developing systems that can continue to generate their own code based on objects and scenarios encountered in the real world. The new work on display today is Code as Policies (CaP). Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google Google Research Intern Jacky Liang and Robotics Research Scientist Andy Zeng note in a blog post: With CaP, we propose using language models to directly write robot code through few-shot prompting. Our experiments demonstrate that outputting code led to improved generalization and task performance over directly learning robot tasks and outputting natural language actions. CaP allows a single system to perform a variety of complex and varied robotic tasks without task-specific training. The system, as described, also relies on third-party libraries and APIs to best generate the code suited to a specific scenario \u2014 as well as support for languages and (why not?) emojis. The information accessible in those APIs are one of the existing limitations at present. The researchers note, \u201cThese limitations point to avenues for future work, including extending visual language models to describe low-level robot behaviors (e.g., trajectories) or combining CaPs with exploration algorithms that can autonomously add to the set of control primitives.\u201d As part of today\u2019s announcement, Google is releasing open source versions of the code accessible through its GitHub site to build on the research it\u2019s thus far presented. So, you know, all of the caveats about early-stage research stuff here.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/02/google-wants-robots-to-generate-their-own-code/", "threshold": 0.7137382259454947}
