{"title": "PaLM-SayCan", "content": "Google Research and Everyday Robots are bringing together cutting\u2011edge, natural language research with robots that can learn. Link to Youtube Video This demo shows a PaLM-enabled helper robot performing a series of complex tasks using chain of thought prompting and the step-by-step solution needed to carry out the requests. Select a task for the helper robot See how PaLM-SayCan interprets the task See how the helper robot executes the task Learn the step-by-step solution behind PaLM-SayCan Robots struggle to understand complex instructions that require reasoning. By using an advanced language model, PaLM-SayCan splits prompts into sub-tasks for the helper robot to execute, one-by-one. This also makes it a lot easier for people to get help from robots \u2013 just ask using everyday language. As you can see, these four tasks start the same, but have varying ends. See how slightly changing the request affects the interpretation.               The user has asked for a drink and a snack. I will bring a water bottle and an apple.                           The user has asked me to bring a drink that isn't caffeinated. I will bring the water bottle.                           The user has asked me to bring a snack that has energy. I will bring an energy bar.                           The user has asked for a snack that is more filling. I will bring multigrain chips.                           The user has asked me to bring them a replacement for their orange soda. I will bring them a new one.                           The user has asked me to bring something to clean up the orange soda. I will bring the sponge.                           The user has asked me to throw away the orange soda. I will move it to the trash.                           The user has asked me to do three tasks. I will do one and then the other.                       After a task has been requested, PaLM-SayCan uses chain of thought prompting, which interprets the instruction in order to score the likelihood that an individual skill makes progress towards completing the high-level request.         Unlike typical robotic demos that perform a single task in a constrained environment, this research shows you can ask an Everyday Robots helper robot for assistance, and it can carry out the request in a real-world environment using reasoning. Multiple safety layers exist on the helper robot, including hardware safety layers, e\u2011stop, and move\u2011to\u2011contact behaviors.

PaLM-SayCan is constrained to commands that are safe for a robot to perform. I just worked out. Can you bring me a drink and a snack to recover? This is how the language model has interpreted the request through chain of thought prompting. The user has asked for a drink and a snack. I will bring a water bottle and an apple. PaLM-SayCan is highly interpretable. We can clearly examine and learn from every decision the system makes. The language model first scores whether each step is useful for completing the task. The affordance model scores whether each step is possible for the robot and environment. These scores are combined and the highest combination is chosen. This gives a step that is possible and useful for the request. The robot then executes that step and repeats this process in the new state. find a water find an apple find an energy bar find a lime soda find a 7up find a water find an apple find an energy bar find a lime soda find a 7up pick up the water find an apple bring it to you pick up the apple put down the water bring it to you find an apple put down the water pick up the apple find an energy bar put down the water find an apple put down the apple done put down the energy bar find an apple find an energy bar done find a water find a lime soda pick up the apple bring it to you pick up the water put down the apple pick up the energy bar bring it to you put down the apple go to the table pick up the apple put down the water put down the apple put down the water done put down the energy bar put down the orange soda done find an apple find a water put down the apple find an energy bar find a water find an apple find an energy bar find a lime soda find a 7up pick up the water find an apple bring it to you pick up the apple put down the water bring it to you find an apple put down the water pick up the apple find an energy bar put down the water find an apple put down the apple done put down the energy bar find an apple find an energy bar done find a water find a lime soda pick up the apple bring it to you pick up the water put down the apple pick up the energy bar bring it to you put down the apple go to the table pick up the apple put down the water put down the apple put down the water done put down the energy bar put down the orange soda done find an apple find a water put down the apple find an energy bar This is the request the human has given the robot.
