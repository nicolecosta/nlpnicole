{"title": "Overview | Sun \u2013 NASA Solar System Exploration", "content": "Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star \u2013 a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, and without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet.  The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun\u2019s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). The Sun\u2019s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends out, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system. The Helioviewer Project allows everyone to explore the Sun using intuitive interfaces and novel technology. Explore the Sun NASA and other international space agencies monitor the Sun 24/7 with a fleet of spacecraft, studying everything from its atmosphere to its surface, and even peering inside the Sun using special instruments. Sun-exploring spacecraft include Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, SOHO,  ACE, IRIS, WIND, Hinode, Solar Dynamics Observatory, and STEREO.  Everything you need to know about your star. Sun In Depth  The Sun is about 100 times wider than Earth and about 10 times wider than Jupiter, the biggest planet. If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be about the size of a nickel. The Sun is the only star in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system, and its gravity holds the solar system together. Everything in our solar system revolves around it \u2013 the planets, asteroids, comets, and tiny bits of space debris. Measuring a \u201cday\u201d on the Sun is complicated because of the way it rotates. It doesn't spin as a single, solid ball. This is because the Sun\u2019s surface isn't solid like Earth's. Instead, the Sun is made of super-hot, electrically charged gas called plasma. This plasma rotates at different speeds on different parts of the Sun. At its equator, the Sun completes one rotation in 25 Earth days. At its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days. SUN SHINING\u00a0IN EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET The part of the Sun we see from Earth \u2013 the part we call the surface \u2013 is the photosphere. The Sun doesn\u2019t actually have a solid surface because it\u2019s a ball of plasma. Above the Sun\u2019s surface are its thin chromosphere and the huge corona (crown). This is where we see features such as solar prominences, flares, and coronal mass ejections. The latter two are giant explosions of energy and particles that can reach Earth. The Sun doesn\u2019t have moons, but it\u2019s orbited by eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, tens of thousands of asteroids, and perhaps three trillion comets and icy bodies. Several spacecraft are currently investigating the Sun including Parker Solar Probe, STEREO, Solar Orbiter, SOHO, Solar Dynamics Observatory, Hinode, IRIS, and Wind. The Sun would have been surrounded by a disk of gas and dust early in its history when the solar system was first forming 4.6 billion years ago. Some of that dust is still around today, in several dust rings that circle the Sun. They trace the orbits of planets, whose gravity tugs dust into place around the Sun.\u00a0 Nothing could live on the Sun, but its energy is vital for most life on Earth. The temperature in the Sun's core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius) \u2013 hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. This creates outward pressure that supports the star's gigantic mass, keeping it from collapsing. \u200b   The Sun has inspired us since ancient times. It\u2019s central to mythology and religion in cultures around the world, including the ancient Egyptians, the Aztecs of Mexico, Native American tribes of North and South America, the Chinese, and many others. Countless musicians have written songs about the Sun. The Beatles had a hit in 1969 with \u201cHere Comes the Sun.\u201d Other popular songs that reference the Sun include: \u201cWalkin\u2019 on the Sun\u201d by Smashmouth; \u201cAin\u2019t No Sunshine\u201d by Bill Withers; \u201cWalking on Sunshine\u201d by Katrina and the Waves; \u201cPocketful of Sunshine\u201d by Natasha Bedingfield; and \u201cLet the Sunshine In\u201d by the Fifth Dimension. If you're Superman or a fellow Kryptonian, your powers are heightened by the yellow glow of our Sun, and you can even dispose of dangerous materials, as Superman and Superboy did, by hurling them into the Sun. In the 1990 science fiction film \u201cSolar Crisis,\u201d a huge solar flare is about to scorch Earth. Astronauts are supposed to use a bomb to divert the flare. In the 2007 film \u201cSunshine,\u201d the Sun is dying, plummeting Earth into a deep freeze. To save humanity, astronauts try to reignite the Sun with a bomb, though things don't quite go as planned. In the 2019 film \u201cThe Wandering Earth,\u201d once again the Sun is dying, but there\u2019s no bomb this time. Instead, people build giant rocket thrusters to move the Earth to a new star system. (Like all stars, the Sun will eventually run out of energy \u2013 but scientists don\u2019t expect this to happen for another 5 billion years or so.)  The Sun is a star. There are lots of stars in the universe, but the Sun is the closest one to Earth, and it\u2019s the only one in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system. The Sun is a hot ball of glowing gases. It keeps our planet warm enough for living things to grow.  It gives us light so we can see. The planets orbit the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris also orbit the Sun.
