Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings \u2013 made of chunks of ice and rock \u2013 but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Everything you need to know about Saturn. Saturn In Depth  Nine Earths side by side would almost span Saturn\u2019s diameter. That doesn\u2019t include Saturn\u2019s rings. Saturn is the sixth planet from our Sun (a star) and orbits at a distance of about 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from the Sun. Saturn takes about 10.7 hours (no one knows precisely) to rotate on its axis once\u2014a Saturn \u201cday\u201d\u2014and 29 Earth years to orbit the sun. Saturn is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid surface like Earth\u2019s. But it might have a solid core somewhere in there. Saturn's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He). Saturn has 53 known moons with an additional 29 moons awaiting confirmation of their discovery\u2014that is a total of 82 moons. Saturn has the most spectacular ring system, with seven rings and several gaps and divisions between them. Few missions have visited Saturn: Pioneer 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2 flew by; But Cassini orbited Saturn 294 times from 2004 to 2017. Saturn cannot support life as we know it, but some of Saturn's moons have conditions that might support life. About two tons of Saturn\u2019s mass came from Earth\u2014the Cassini spacecraft was intentionally vaporized in Saturn\u2019s atmosphere in 2017.  Perhaps the most iconic of all the planets in our solar system, Saturn is heavily present in pop culture. It provides a backdrop for numerous science fiction stories, movies, and TV shows, comics, and video games, including the \"Cthulhu Mythos,\" \"WALL-E,\" \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Dead Space 2,\" and \"Final Fantasy VII.\" In Tim Burton's film \"Beetlejuice,\" a dusty, fictional Saturn is populated by giant sandworms. And in the 2014 movie \"Interstellar,\" the wormhole that enables the astronauts to travel to another galaxy appears near Saturn. Saturn is also the namesake of Saturday, arguably the best day of the week.\u200b  Saturn isn\u2019t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones. The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They\u2019re made of chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.
