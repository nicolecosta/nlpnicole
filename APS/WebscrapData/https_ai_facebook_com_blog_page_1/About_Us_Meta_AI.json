{"title": "About Us - Meta AI", "content": "Because we can\u2019t truly advance groundbreaking AI alone, we share our research and engage with the AI community to advance the science, together. Whether it be in AI Infrastructure, Generative AI, NLP, Computer Vision or other core areas of AI, our focus is to connect people in inspiring ways through collaborative, responsible AI innovation. We\u2019re actively building remarkable things in key areas of AI that are shaping an AI-driven future. A future we aim to enhance through our many, diverse fundamental and applied research projects. We\u2019re exploring and discovering the frontier of AI along with everyone else. So we too need guidance as we maneuver through its many possibilities. By listening to subject matter experts, policymakers and people with lived experiences, we aim to be proactive in the promotion and advancement of responsible design and operation of AI systems. As we do so, we adhere to our organization\u2019s core principles: Privacy & Security, Fairness & Inclusion, Robustness & Safety, Transparency & Control, Accountability & Governance.

Openness We believe the latest advancements in AI should be published and shared for the community to learn from and build upon. Collaboration We collaborate openly with both internal and external partners to share knowledge and cultivate diverse perspectives and needs. Excellence There\u2019s no shortage of new possibilities to explore in AI. While our researchers focus on what they believe will have the most positive impact on people and society, our engineers are working to deliver meaningful advancements in products and experiences for all people. Scale To bring the benefits of AI to more people and improve accessibility, our research must account for both large scale data and computational needs. Throughout the year, we connect with the AI community through a variety of virtual, in-person and hybrid industry and academic events \u2014 as a participating sponsor or as host. At these events, our engineers and researchers share our latest product developments, research breakthroughs and publications. We\u2019re passionate about introducing people to the extraordinary world of AI. Our AI Mentorship (AIM) and EMEA programs let PhD candidates conduct open science research in collaboration with their university, academic advisor, and Meta AI mentor participants as full-time Meta AI employees.We currently have agreements in place with prestigious universities in the United States, France, Israel and the United Kingdom.
