We use Cookies for a variety of purposes and to enhance your online experience, for example, by remembering your log-in status and viewing preferences from a previous use of an online service, for when you later return to that online service. In particular, our Site uses the following categories of Cookies as described in Section 2 of our Privacy Notice: Your use of our Site indicates your consent to such use of Cookies, unless otherwise specified. Cookies used for Analytics and Performance, Service Cookies, and Functionality cookies are considered strictly necessary, or Essential, and are collected from all users based on Our legitimate interest and for a business purpose, such as bug fixing, bot detection, security, providing the content, providing an account or Service, and loading necessary applications among other similar uses.

For further information about our use of Cookies and your opt-out choices, see Your Cookie Choices And How To Opt-Out. See here for examples of each type of cookie used on our Site. The advertising networks and/or content providers that deliver ads on our Site use cookies to uniquely distinguish your web browser and keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the web pages on which the ads appeared. Many of these companies combine information they collect from our Site with other information they have independently collected relating to your web browser\u2019s activities across their network of websites. These companies collect and use this information under their own privacy policies. These companies, their privacy policies and the opt-outs they offer can be found in the table below. You can also opt-out of additional third-party advertising networks by going to the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Website, the Digital Advertising Alliance AdChoices Website, or the European DAA Website (for the EU/UK), the AppChoices Website (for mobile app opt-out) and following the directions there. Although we are not responsible for the effectiveness of these opt-out solutions, and in additional to other specific rights, California residents are entitled to know the effects of opt-out options under California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b)(7). The effect of an opt-out, if successful, will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics and internal Site operation purposes). You have the choice whether to accept the use of Cookies and we have explained how you can exercise your rights below. Most browsers are initially set up to accept HTTP cookies.

Controlling the HTML5 local storage on your browser depends on which browser you use.

The following third-parties that collect information from you on our Site have given us notice that you can obtain information on their policies and practices, and in some instances opt-out of certain of their activities, as follows: Unless otherwise specified, if you do not opt out, as provided through the various methods herein, you expressly consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your information by us and the third parties listed above, subject to their privacy policies, preferences, and opt-outs available through the links set forth above.

For more information about online tracking and options to prevent most tracking visit the Future of Privacy Forum site. A cookie (sometimes referred to as local storage object or LSO) is a data file placed on a device. Cookies can be created through a variety of web-related protocols and technologies, such as HTTP (sometimes referred to as \u201cbrowser cookies\u201d), HTML5, or Adobe Flash. For more information on third-party cookies that we use for analytics, please review the table of cookies and tracking technologies within this Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as \u201c1\u00d71 GIFs\u201d or \u201cclear GIFs\u201d) can be included in our online service\u2019s pages and messages. Web beacons are invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to HTTP cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. If a user can be positively identified across multiple devices, for instance, because the user has logged into a platform such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo or Twitter, it can be \u201cdetermined\u201d who the user is for purposes of improving customer service. Probabilistic tracking depends upon collecting non-personal data regarding device attributes like operating system, device make and model, IP addresses, ad requests and location data, and making statistical inferences to link multiple devices to a single user. Note that this is accomplished through proprietary algorithms owned by the companies performing probabilistic finger-printing. Note also that in the EU IP Addresses are personal information. Device graphs can be created by combining non-personal data regarding use of smartphones and other devices with personal log-in information to track interactions with content across multiple devices. \u201cUnique Identifier Header (UIDH) is the address information that accompanies Internet (http) requests transmitted over an ISP\u2019s wireless network. For example, when a customer types on his or her phone the web address of a retailer that request travels over the network and is delivered to the retailer\u2019s website. The information included in that request includes things like the device type and screen size so that the retailer site knows how to best display the site on the phone. The UIDH is included in this information, and can be used as an anonymous way for advertisers to be able to determine that the user is part of a group that a third-party advertiser is attempting to reach. It is important to note that the UIDH is a temporary, anonymous identifier included with unencrypted web traffic. We change the UIDH on a regular basis to protect the privacy of our customers. We do not use the UIDH to collect web browsing information and it does not broadcast individuals\u2019 web browsing activity out to advertisers or others.\u201d An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the online service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the online service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. A feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of device identifier. ETag tracking generates unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies. For each user that accepts push notifications in mobile apps, the app developer is provided with a unique device token (think of it as an address) from the app platform (e.g., Apple and Google). The unique series of numbers and letters assigned to your device.
