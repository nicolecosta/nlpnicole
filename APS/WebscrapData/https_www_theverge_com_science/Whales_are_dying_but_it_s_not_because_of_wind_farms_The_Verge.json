{"title": "Whales are dying, but it\u2019s not because of wind farms - The Verge", "content": "By  Justine Calma, a science reporter covering the environment, climate, and energy with a decade of experience. She is also the host of the Hell or High Water podcast. Beaches have become makeshift necropsy labs along the shores of New York and New Jersey. An alarming number of whales are washing up along the east coast of the US. And when they do, a team of researchers arrives at the scene to hunt for clues pointing to a cause of death.\u00a0 They start by examining the outside of the body. Are there teeth marks from an attack? Or are there telltale signs of an accident with a ship: gashes from propellers, rust that has rubbed off from the vessel, broken bones or flesh that\u2019s been pushed in from the impact? \u201cI can certainly tell you from my experience, I\u2019ve seen a lot of ship-struck whales,\u201d says Joy Reidenberg, who\u2019s typically on call for such investigations. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of ship-struck whales\u201d The victims have become posthumous poster children for opponents of offshore wind energy \u2014 despite a lack of any evidence that wind farms are to blame. That distracts from very real risks shipping vessels pose to whales navigating US shorelines, experts say. More than 30 dead whales have washed ashore on the east coast since December 31st, many of them in New Jersey and New York. It can be incredibly difficult to figure out a cause of death \u2014 a grim task scientists often volunteer to help out with on their own time. And while they\u2019re not always able to find the answers they\u2019re looking for, what they see time and again is evidence of run-ins with ships. \u201cThe data seems to be pointing overwhelmingly to ship strikes,\u201d says Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist at the Icahn School of Medicine whose research focuses on marine mammals.\u00a0 Reidenberg volunteers for New York\u2019s Atlantic Marine Conservation Society and New Jersey\u2019s Marine Mammal Stranding Center, organizations authorized to respond to stranded whales. When there\u2019s been a whale death, she\u2019ll get a call from one of the organizations asking her to join the mostly volunteer team dispatched to perform a necropsy.\u00a0 \u201cMy job is usually to be a cutter, which means that I have the big knives and I cut the animal open,\u201d she tells The Verge. \u201cThat usually goes to someone who\u2019s had a lot of experience \u2026 and knows their way around the anatomy, which can be very disorienting when you\u2019re basically standing in the middle of the animal trying to dissect it.\u201d\u00a0 A team of 12 or more people might spend up to 12 hours doing all this grueling work at the beach \u2014 and that\u2019s a short day, according to Robert DiGiovanni, chief scientist at Atlantic Marine Conservation Society. Ultimately, DiGiovanni\u2019s organization combines two assessments \u2014 one from the necropsy team at the beach and another from a pathologist studying tissue samples \u2014 to write up a report on what might have led to the animal\u2019s death. Even after all that, it can be very difficult to determine what happened to the whale. Most whales initially sink when they die. They\u2019ll float to the surface once they start to decompose, filling the body with gas. By the time they reach shore, they\u2019re often in gruesome shape. Sometimes the carcass is too decomposed for a full necropsy, or it\u2019s spotted floating but never drifts ashore for scientists to examine.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society and similar organizations in other states send their findings to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which tracks what\u2019s going on nationally. Most of those that have washed up recently are humpback whales. Their haunting songs, released on an iconic 1970 album during the same year as the very first Earth Day, became a soundtrack for the early environmental movement and \u201csave the whales\u201d campaigns.\u00a0 Since 2016, so many humpbacks have died that NOAA declared an \u201cunusual mortality event\u201d (UME) along the Atlantic coast. There have been 191 humpback whale beachings since then; all but 10 of them died, and the UME still hasn\u2019t ended.\u00a0 Only 91 of the whales were able to be examined, and the cause of death for 44 of those came up as \u201cundetermined.\u201d But the most common threat by far is vessel strike, suspected in the deaths of 32 whales. Next on the list is suspected entanglement with fishing gear, affecting nine whales. That\u2019s according to preliminary data NOAA shared with The Verge, with the caveat that some cases are still pending test results to determine whether the whale was struck before or after it died.\u00a0 There\u2019s been another unusual mortality event since 2017 for the North Atlantic right whale, one of the most endangered species of large whale in the world. There have been 36 right whale deaths documented since then. That\u2019s especially alarming given how few right whales are believed to be left \u2014 fewer than 350, according to NOAA. Officials track their deaths more closely because of that endangered status.\u00a0 The leading cause of death nationally for right whales has been vessel strike, accounting for 12 of 23 cases for which a necropsy was able to determine a cause of death. And of the two deaths documented so far in 2023, the causes have been vessel strike or perinatal mortality (meaning a fetus died). Zooming in on New Jersey, which has had more whale strandings or beachings than any other state since December, four of five complete necropsies performed on all whales similarly found evidence of a vessel strike. Vessel strikes and entanglement are also the leading factors contributing to whale deaths in New York, according to DiGiovanni.\u00a0 A perfect storm of factors has made collisions with ships more likely. To start, more whales have been spotted close to shore. Research suggests that they\u2019re following their food, a bony fish called menhaden that have become more prevalent in the New York Bight that stretches from New Jersey to New York City and Long Island. Conservation efforts and climate change both could have made these waters more attractive \u2014 they\u2019re both cleaner and warmer than they\u2019ve been in the past.\u00a0 But then, in 2017, the Bayonne Bridge was raised by 64 feet to allow through modern, massive container ships. The US Army Corps of Engineers also deepened the navigational channels around the Port of New York and New Jersey to let them in.\u00a0 Before then, the number of different container ships to visit the port was just 99 in total in 2016. And none of them were the super-size vessels of today that can carry more than 9,000 TEUs (standard-sized shipping containers). By 2021, the total number of container ships had grown to 550, according to the Port of New York and New Jersey. And 28 percent of those ships were large enough to carry more than 9,000 TEUs. That\u2019s on top of the buzz of cruise ships, ferries, and other ship traffic in the area. The Port of New York and New Jersey is now the busiest in the US, handling more cargo than any other port. It\u2019s a seismic shift that\u2019s taken place since the pandemic simultaneously snarled supply chains and fueled a boom in online shopping.  Americans started buying more consumer goods for home improvement projects and new hobbies, and more of that stuff started making its way east instead of landing on the west coast. The amount of imported furniture the Port of New York and New Jersey brought in between 2019 and 2022\u00a0jumped from 449,266 to 598,739 TEUs (standard-sized shipping containers) \u2014 a roughly 33 percent increase. California\u2019s Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach held the top spot in the nation for years, mostly because it\u2019s much closer to Asia. A cargo ship could sail from China to the west coast in nine days, compared to a 30-day trip to the east coast. Then, during the covid pandemic, ships started piling up at California ports, at times waiting more than two weeks to unload their cargo. Suddenly, it became faster to bring goods into the country through the Port of New York and New Jersey.\u00a0 Larger vessels can lug around more stuff and make fewer trips. So the number of visits that ships make to the Port of New York and New Jersey hasn\u2019t grown as much as the amount of cargo flowing into the port. The biggest issue for the whales is the sheer size of the ships.\u00a0 From his Staten Island apartment, Paul Sieswerda can see them from his window \u2014 although he\u2019s hoping to spot whales. \u201cThe container ships are just amazingly large,\u201d Sieswerda says. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but our observations are that the whales are kind of oblivious to all this. You know, we see them feeding \u2026 the analogy of deer on the highway is kind of fitting,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Sieswerda is the executive director of Gotham Whale, a nonprofit whale research organization that keeps a database of marine mammal sightings around the New York Bight (Reidenberg is also a scientific adviser for Gotham Whale). They see a lot of whales with what look like scars from boat propellers. \u201cOur favorite whale Jerry has a long line of propeller marks on his right flank,\u201d Sieswerda says, which shows that Jerry has survived a run-in with a smaller vessel. \u201cIf he was ever hit by one of the bigger vessels, it would kill him,\u201d he says. When it comes to risks posed by offshore wind, Sieswerda says, \u201cI, as yet, have not seen the concerns backed up with evidence.\u201d The Marine Mammal Commission, an independent government agency, also said that \u201cthere is no evidence to link these strandings to offshore wind energy development.\u201d Even so, Republican lawmakers in New Jersey held a two-hour-long hearing last week calling for a moratorium on offshore wind construction because of the whale strandings. \u201cOne thing our side of the aisle gets accused of is not following the science,\u201d Republican state Senator Michael Testa said. \u201cSo what is the harm of waiting 30 or 60 days?\u201d Seismic surveys have just begun to map out future wind farm sites, which is what offshore wind opponents say poses a risk to whales. Marine mammals that use echolocation to navigate might be disoriented by unnatural sounds. But Reidenberg, the comparative anatomist, doesn\u2019t expect that to be a problem for humpback or right whales for one simple reason.\u00a0 \u201cThe whales that are washing in are not echolocators. So that\u2019s where a half-truth really unfairly biases the public against something,\u201d she says. A seismic survey for offshore wind development is much quieter than surveys for offshore oil and gas drilling since the sonar doesn\u2019t have to travel as deep into the seafloor. The US has no commercial-scale offshore wind farms yet, something the Biden administration wants to change as part of its transition to clean energy. It set a goal of generating 30 GW of electricity from offshore wind by 2030, about as much capacity as Europe already has today. NOAA says on its website that \u201cthere is no evidence that noise resulting from wind development-related site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales, and no specific links between recent large whale mortalities and currently ongoing surveys.\u201d To protect whales, action needs to be based on data, researchers tell The Verge. There\u2019s enough evidence to show that big shipping containers pose risks, but there are also measures that can minimize that risk.\u00a0 The speed of a vessel can make a big difference in how much reaction time there is to avoid a collision with a whale. So NOAA proposed an updated speed limit last year to protect North Atlantic right whales. Even so, the speed restrictions primarily target areas where critically endangered right whales hang out, not humpbacks. The Port of New York and New Jersey, for its part, has a program to offer financial incentives to ships that voluntarily slow down to 10 knots or less as they get closer to shore.\u00a0 Democratic lawmakers have also pressed NOAA to share data on necropsy results more quickly and to determine what kinds of resources it needs to take more action on the unusual mortality events.\u00a0DiGiovanni, whose organization responds to strandings in New York state, says he\u2019d ideally want to have the resources to send teams twice as big as he has in the past to perform necropsies.\u00a0 Of course, he says, \u201cI would like to not have to go through this at all.\u201d  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.
