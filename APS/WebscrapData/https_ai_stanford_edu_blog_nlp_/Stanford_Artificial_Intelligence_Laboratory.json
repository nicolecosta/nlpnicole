{"title": "Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory", "content": "The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) has been a center of excellence for Artificial Intelligence research, teaching, theory, and practice since its founding in 1963. See over eight hours of video from Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory researchers speaking on April 13, 2023. Professor Chelsea Finn and PhD Student Tony Zhao have now introduced a system for fine-grained robotic manipulation that relies on low-cost hardware and imitation learning directly from real demonstrations. Are they sentient? Are they safe? Will they take my job? Stanford PhD student Eric Mitchell answers the internet\u2019s questions on AI chatbots From deepfakes to Bing\u2019s chatbot, AI-generated content is everywhere. Here\u2019s how to spot it. The fellows are \u201cearly-career scholars represent[ing] the most promising scientific researchers working today. Their achievements and potential place them among the next generation of scientific leaders in the U.S. and Canada.\u201d The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab has a rich history which you can learn about in a new video on AI at Stanford from 1962 to 2022.

And yes, our lab has been exceptionally clean \ud83e\uddf9Many of you commented on the mobile platform which I'm so pleased about seeing it move!Let me tell you the story behind these platforms!\ud83e\uddf5https://twitter.com/jimmyyhwu/status/1656982989774127104?s=20 When organizing a home, everyone has unique preferences for where things go.
