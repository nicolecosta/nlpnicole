{"title": "Jure Leskovec @ Stanford", "content": "I am Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University.      My general research area is applied machine learning for large interconnected systems focusing on modeling complex, richly-labeled relational structures, graphs, and networks for systems at all scales, from interactions of proteins in a cell to interactions between humans in a society. Applications include commonsense reasoning, recommender systems, computational social science, and computational biology with an emphasis on drug discovery.
