{"title": "Google at ICLR 2023 \u2013 Google AI Blog", "content": " The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023) is being held this week as a hybrid event in Kigali, Rwanda. We are proud to be a Diamond Sponsor of ICLR 2023, a premier conference on deep learning, where Google researchers contribute at all levels. This year we are presenting over 100 papers and are actively involved in organizing and hosting a number of different events, including workshops and interactive sessions. If you\u2019re registered for ICLR 2023, we hope you\u2019ll visit the Google booth to learn more about the exciting work we\u2019re doing across topics spanning representation and reinforcement learning, theory and optimization, social impact, safety and privacy, and applications from generative AI to speech and robotics.
