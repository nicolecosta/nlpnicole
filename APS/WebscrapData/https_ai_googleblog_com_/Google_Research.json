{"title": "Google Research", "content": "Google Research tackles challenges that define the technology of today and tomorrow. Our researchers publish regularly in academic journals, release projects as open source, and apply research to Google products. See some of our latest research developments from the Google Research Blog and elsewhere. Learn how we challenge conventions. See some of our most recent research. As Big Data has altered the face of research, the same factors of Volume, Velocity and Variety used to define it, are changing the opportunities of analytic data exploration as well; thus, the introduction of the term Big Analytics. Improvement in algorithms and computing power provide the foundation to produce automated platforms that can identify patterns in analytic model results beyond... Jonathan Kroening,  Rich Timpone,  Yongwei Yang  BigSurv 18 (Big Data Meet Survey Science) conference, Barcelona, Spain (2018) The recent years have seen an explosive growth in web and mobile application development. Such applications typically have rapid development cycles, expect mobile-friendly features and serverless characteristics such as rapid deployment (with minimal provisioning) capabilities, scalability to handle workload spikes, and convenient pay-as-you-go billing. Google\u2019s Firestore is a NoSQL serverless... Ram Kesavan,  David Gay,  Daniel Thevessen,  Jimit Shah,  C. Mohan  2023 IEEE 39th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), pp. 3367-3379 Video streaming services are among the largest web applications in production, and a large source of downstream internet traffic. A large-scale video streaming service at Google, YouTube, leverages a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve its users. A key consideration in providing a seamless service is cache efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate machine learning techniques to improve the...

Using a continuous cellular automata called Lenia as the base system, we built large-scale evolutionary simulations using parallel computing framework JAX, in order to achieve the goal of never-ending... Bert Wang-Chak Chan  GECCO '23: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, ACM (2023) (to appear) Background Photographs of the external eye were recently shown to reveal signs of diabetic retinal disease and elevated glycated haemoglobin. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that external eye photographs contain information about additional systemic medical conditions. Methods We developed a deep learning system (DLS) that takes external eye photographs as input and predicts systemic...

Maa,  Ramasamy Kim,  Eugene Yu-Chuan Kang,  Yossi Matias,  Greg Corrado,  Lily Peng,  Dale Webster,  Christopher Semturs,  Jonathan Krause,  Avinash Varadarajan,  Naama Hammel,  Yun Liu  Lancet Digital Health (2023) Text reading order is a crucial aspect in the output of an OCR engine, with a large impact on downstream tasks. Its difficulty lies in the large variation of domain specific layout structures, and is further exacerbated by real-world image degradations such as perspective distortions. We propose a lightweight, scalable and generalizable approach to identify text reading order with a multi-... Renshen Wang,  Yasuhisa Fujii,  Alessandro Bissacco  International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) (2023) (to appear) We present a method to separate speech signals from noisy environments in the embedding space of a neural audio codec. We introduce a new training procedure that allows our model to produce structured encodings of audio waveforms given by embedding vectors, where one part of the embedding vector represents the speech signal, and the rest represent the environment. We achieve this by... Ahmed Omran,  F\u00e9lix de Chaumont Quitry,  Malcolm Slaney,  Marco Tagliasacchi,  Neil Zeghidour,  Zal\u00e1n Borsos  ICASSP 2023 (2023) (to appear) Neural machine translation (NMT) has progressed rapidly over the past several years, and modern models are able to achieve relatively high quality using only monolingual text data, an approach dubbed Unsupervised Machine Translation, or UNMT. However, these models still struggle in a variety of ways, including aspects of translation that for a human are the easiest---for instance, correctly... Alex Jones,  Isaac Caswell,  Orhan Firat  ArXiv (2023) Recent work in visual end-to-end learning for robotics has shown the promise of imitation learning across a variety of tasks. However, such approaches are often expensive and require vast amounts of real world training demonstrations. Additionally, they rely on a time-consuming evaluation process for identifying the best model to deploy in the real world. These challenges can be mitigated by... Armando Fuentes,  Daniel Ho,  Eric Victor Jang,  Matt Bennice,  Mohi Khansari,  Nicolas Sievers,  Sean Kirmani,  Yunfei Bai,  Yuqing Du  ICRA (2023) (to appear) We describe \u201cDiscover AI in Daily Life\u201d, a lesson in Google\u2019s Applied Digital Skills curriculum. The lesson introduces elements of AI literacy and is freely available online at g.co/DiscoverAI. It is designed for middle school students while also supporting high school and adult learners.
