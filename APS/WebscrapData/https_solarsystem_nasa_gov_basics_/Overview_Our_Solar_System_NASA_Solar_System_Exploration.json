{"title": "Overview | Our Solar System \u2013 NASA Solar System Exploration", "content": "There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is called \u201cthe solar system\u201d because we use the word \u201csolar\u201d to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, \"solis.\" Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity \u2013 the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way. Everything you need to know about your galactic neighborhood. Solar System In Depth  Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets, and countless smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets. Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We\u2019re in one of the galaxy\u2019s four spiral arms. It takes our solar system about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.  There are three general kinds of galaxies: elliptical, spiral, and irregular. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. Our solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere. But it contains many worlds \u2013 including Earth \u2013 with many kinds of atmospheres. The planets of our solar system \u2013 and even some asteroids \u2013 hold more than 200 moons in their orbits. The four giant planets \u2013 and at least one asteroid \u2013 have rings. None are as spectacular as Saturn\u2019s gorgeous rings. More than 300 robotic spacecraft have explored destinations beyond Earth's orbit,\u00a0including 24 American astronauts who made the trip from the Earth to the Moon. Our solar system is the only one known to support life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we\u2019re looking for more everywhere we can. NASA\u2019s Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are the only spacecraft\u00a0to leave our solar system. Three\u00a0other spacecraft \u2013\u00a0Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and New Horizons\u00a0\u2013\u00a0will eventually hit interstellar space.  Five spacecraft have achieved enough velocity to eventually travel beyond the boundaries of our solar system. Two of them reached the unexplored space between the stars after several decades in space.
