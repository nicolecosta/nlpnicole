By Mike Orcutt The pitch sounds like an echo from the distant crypto past, when the blockchain was not only going to fight climate change\u00a0but also cure cancer. Log on to Minecraft clone OPCraft and\u2014through the magic of decentralized cryptography\u2014experience true gaming freedom. The pixelated world closely resembles its role model both in aesthetics and gameplay. As in Minecraft, the environment that OPCraft players explore is made up of blocks, which players can move, destroy, and combine to produce new materials. OPCraft was built by crypto devotees who disdain the format of the most popular crypto games, which generally take conventional game designs and add a cryptocurrency element on top, often centered on making money exchanged as digital currency or NFTs.\u00a0 The creators of OPCraft are trying to establish a new genre of games shaped more fundamentally by blockchains. Their rules and core mechanisms are encoded into smart contracts\u2014software applications that encode an agreement\u2014linked to the\u00a0Ethereum blockchain. The game, which debuted in October for a two-week test period, is meant to demonstrate a vision its developers call an autonomous world\u2014a digital space owned and controlled not by a single, centralized entity but by a decentralized network of people interacting with a blockchain. OPCraft is not the first on-chain game, and dozens more are in the works, setting out to build gaming worlds their creators describe as \u201csovereign\u201d or \u201ceternal.\u201d At a time when the games industry is more lucrative and corporate than ever, these projects are trying to show that it\u2019s possible to rethink some long-established patterns\u2014like the fact that a game\u2019s code typically lives on a privately owned server and can be changed or removed on a whim by its owners. The challenge now for these crypto idealists is to build games that demonstrate and prove out those ideals. If they can do that, they might change the conventional wisdom about what blockchains can do, too, by showing that they\u2019re useful for more than just cryptocurrency and\u00a0NFTs. In-game screenshot of OPCraft. Justin Glibert, cofounder of the blockchain research nonprofit 0xPARC, is\u00a0quick to acknowledge that the idea of online games offering a new canvas for self-expression might not sound very new. But he argues that the freedom offered by conventional games is partly an illusion. Players of the 20-year-old space-themed game\u00a0Eve Online, like devotees of other online multiplayer games, invest huge amounts of time and energy into their play, creating and running sophisticated organizations and maintaining genuine relationships. Players feel like they\u2019re free to shape their own destiny inside the game. But Glibert says that freedom can in fact be yanked away at any moment by CCP Games, Eve\u2019s owner. \u201cThey believe that CCP is not running the game world,\u201d when in fact it retains total control, says Glibert, who runs a division of 0xPARC called Lattice that builds on-chain games. He says that games built on blockchains can be designed to prevent any one entity from controlling a world\u2019s fate, while also offering new freedom for users to customize and expand on a game\u2019s design. Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff To Morris and Emerson Hsieh, the risk that a game\u2019s creator or owner might wreck the world a community of players loves isn\u2019t just theoretical. In late 2021, the brothers launched a popular custom Minecraft server called Critterz, in which many of the objects were also NFTs. But in July last year, Minecraft\u2019s owner, Mojang, banned the use of crypto and NFTs, and Critterz came crashing down. Morris and Emerson became fixated on the question of how to build compelling games underpinned directly by the blockchain that were more independent and fun than traditional games could be. \u201cIf it\u2019s not fun, nobody\u2019s going to pay any attention to it,\u201d Morris says. The pair are currently building a factory-themed game, called\u00a0Primodium, to demonstrate what they call a decentralized economy, where rules encoded on the blockchain prevent a game\u2019s creator from suddenly changing a key component\u2014say, making a weapon less effective or valuable. Like Glibert\u2019s concept of autonomous worlds, Morris says, the Hsiehs\u2019 proposal boils down to \u201can agreement on the rules.\u201d Once a game\u2019s creator or founding community defines a set of low-level rules, players should be able to trust that they won\u2019t change, similar to the way Bitcoin\u2019s code fixes the supply at 21 million coins. During OPCraft\u2019s test run, some players showed how building games on the blockchain can create new opportunities for creative play.\u00a0 One core rule of the game held that if a player mined enough\u00a0 diamonds, they could claim a tract of land for themselves, preventing anyone else from mining or building on it. One player, calling themself the Supreme Leader of OPCraft, used this rule to claim a huge swathe of land around where new players first arrive in the world when logging in for the first time. The aspiring dictator then announced on Twitter and in the OPCraft Discord channel that they had launched a new Ethereum smart contract that offered players the chance to opt into becoming a member of the Autonomous People\u2019s Republic of OPCraft, a new game within the game. \u201cAll of your private property will be added to the government treasury,\u201d the player wrote, \u201chowever from that point forward you will have access to the near limitless resources of our treasury.\u201d\u00a0 To join, users needed only to download and run a plug-in to OPCraft. Once they were in, the add-on software took over their possessions and also kept track of an individual\u2019s contributions. Citizens could build things on Republic land, but only as long as they were contributing more resources to the treasury than they were taking.\u00a0 The Autonomous People\u2019s Republic was an extreme example of a quality that crypto enthusiasts call permissionlessness, describing a system that permits anyone to build software on top of it. Others built smaller-scale OPCraft plug-ins that let players do things like chat with each other or simply automate the action required to mine diamonds.\u00a0 Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff OPCraft was built to demonstrate blockchain-related features like that, and also to demonstrate a toolkit developed by 0xPARC\u2019s Lattice for building on-chain games. Conventional videogames are often built using game engines such as Unreal Engine that speed up the work by handling lower-level details of the programming of 3D environments and other components. OPCraft was built using software Lattice developed called MUD, an \u201con-chain game engine.\u201d\u00a0 Glibert and a fellow Lattice engineer, who goes by the pseudonym Alvarius, built MUD after struggling to build their own on-chain game. The name borrows an acronym for\u00a0multi-user dungeon, a genre of virtual multiplayer game worlds that originated in the 1970s and inspired online role-playing games like Eve Online. The crypto-era MUD is designed to take care of tricky challenges such as keeping every player\u2019s software in sync with the blockchain and adding new content to a game. Last fall, Glibert\u2019s team hosted a 12-week Autonomous Worlds Residency in London, where 45 participants, including Morris and Emerson Hsieh, built game prototypes using MUD. Most resembled conventional multiplayer games, in a similar vein to OPCraft, but one, named Eat Drain Arson, hinted at the opportunity for on-chain worlds to head off in new directions. The prototype displayed a hovering, skeleton-like goblin. In the demo, the game\u2019s creators, Arthur R\u00f6ing Baer and his cocreator, who goes by the pseudonym GVN, made the goblin do simple actions like eat, start fires, move around a simple map, and gather a finite resource called sludge. Work-in-progress in-game screenshot of Eat Drain Arson. The goblin\u2019s world\u2014and even the point of the game\u2014are still under construction. But it will be designed to encourage players to form cooperative groups if they want to make progress. The game\u2019s developers, who call themselves Moving Castles, took inspiration from the online communities that form on Discord servers and Telegram group chats. They hope the game can incubate collectives that exist beyond the game, such as an in-game organization that has the capability to move to another digital place or platform. \u201cYou start in a constrained world that facilitates the emergence of it, but it\u2019s not constrained by it long-term,\u201d says Baer. As well as trying to prove out new approaches to gaming, experiences built on MUD are also pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. The creators of Ethereum originally promised a \u201cworld computer\u201d that could run anything, including games, on the decentralized network powering the system. That would provide an alternative to conventional, centralized cloud computing and make services resistant to being shut down.\u00a0 The downside is that running software on the blockchain this way is currently slow and expensive. OPCraft made use of a cryptographic system called a \u201crollup,\u201d which combines many individual transactions and periodically links a bundle of them onto the blockchain. Lattice partnered with OP Labs, a startup developing rollup technology, for the OPCraft demonstration. The game, which had more than a hundred players active simultaneously, was a \u201cstress test at the most realistic but also the most innovative level,\u201d says Annie Ke, head of protocol partnerships at OP Labs. She hopes that blockchain games can demonstrate how rollup technology could make blockchains cheaper and easier to use, making ideas like mainstream decentralized financial services and even more general-purpose applications, like\u00a0blockchain-based organizations, more feasible. \ud83d\udce7 Get the best stories from WIRED\u2019s iconic archive in your inbox \ud83c\udfa7 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Where to find the energy to save the world This fanfic sex trope caught a plundering AI red-handed \u201cCash stuffing\u201d is thriving on TikTok The surprising synergy between acupuncture and AI Why suicide rates are dropping around the world \u26fa Embrace the new season with the Gear team\u2019s best picks for best tents, umbrellas, and robot vacuums Reece Rogers Amanda Hoover Khari Johnson Will Knight Laurie Clarke David Nield Paresh Dave Will Knight More From WIRED Contact \u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
