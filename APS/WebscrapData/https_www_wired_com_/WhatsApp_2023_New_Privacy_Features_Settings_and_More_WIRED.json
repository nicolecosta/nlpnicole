To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Matt Burgess In the summer of 2016,\u00a0WhatsApp made an unprecedented change. The\u00a0Meta-owned company\u00a0turned on end-to-end encryption by default for all of the billion-plus people using it\u2014becoming, in the process, the world's largest encrypted messenger. Since then, that number has topped 2 billion. Being end-to-end encrypted by default means nobody at Meta can read, or mine data from, the content of the messages you send. All texts, photos, videos, voice messages, documents, status updates, and calls are encrypted on WhatsApp, and only the people you send them to can access them. Devices decoding encrypted content must verify and exchange security codes as messages are transferred. The encryption that WhatsApp uses was originally developed by Open Whisper Systems, the group behind the\u00a0encrypted messaging app rival Signal. In recent years, WhatsApp has introduced additional privacy and security features you can turn on. But even though WhatsApp\u2019s end-to-end encryption does protect your communications, that doesn\u2019t mean the service is as private as it could be by default. In fact, when it comes to\u00a0WhatsApp versus Signal, we recommend the latter for people wanting the maximum security and privacy options. However, with more than a third of the world using WhatsApp, its popularity is unrivaled, and you may not be able to drag all of your friends, family, and groups across to Signal. If that milestone is still some way off, here are some tips to make WhatsApp as private as possible. Updated May 2023: WhatsApp has introduced new privacy features since this story was first published in 2020. These changes are reflected below. WhatsApp can collect a lot more information about you than you might think. Much of what it collects is similar to many other apps and can be found in its privacy policies. There are separate privacy policies for the\u00a0US,\u00a0Europe, and the\u00a0UK. There are some differences in what WhatsApp collects, based on Europe\u2019s privacy rules. But the app is also part of Meta\u2019s machine, which also includes Facebook and Instagram, and some information is shared with the parent company. The association alone can put people off using WhatsApp. The data WhatsApp has about you can come from multiple different sources: the information you provide (such as your phone number to sign up, or your location when you give it permission to share it with a friend), information that is collected automatically (for instance, when you\u2019re online, or when you made a phone call), and information that others share about you (if a friend uploads your phone number, for example). Automatically collected, WhatsApp says, is information about how you use its services, how often and for how long you are on WhatsApp, and the features you use\u2014including \u201cgroup name, group picture, group description,\u201d your profile photo, \u201cabout information,\u201d and when you were last online. (Some of this information is\u00a0used for safety features.) On top of that, WhatsApp may also collect information about your phone\u2019s battery level, signal strength, and mobile operator. Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff In the US, WhatsApp shares your phone number, phone information, IP address, and\u00a0more with Meta\u2019s other companies, although it says it does not \u201ckeep logs of who everyone\u2019s messaging or calling\u201d and\u00a0doesn\u2019t share contacts with Meta. In Europe, WhatsApp details\u00a0how it works with Meta\u2019s other companies and the information that is shared more explicitly. However, it\u2019s worth stressing that the content of the messages you send isn\u2019t shared, as Meta doesn\u2019t have access to them due to WhatsApp\u2019s\u00a0end-to-end encryption. Location information, when you turn it on, is also collected, and there are cookies that track your activity within the desktop and web versions of the app. WhatsApp allows you to back up your chats and data as a way to move all your information to a new phone. These backups work by storing your data in Google Drive or Apple\u2019s iCloud, depending on which operating system you use. Backups can be handy if you\u2019re moving to a new phone or lose your old device. If you\u2019re going to use WhatsApp\u2019s backups, you should use the version that is end-to-end encrypted. The company introduced these in 2021 after\u00a0years of the option being unavailable. In WhatsApp, go to\u00a0Settings, Chats, Chat Backup, and then once you have turned backups on, tap on\u00a0End-to-end Encrypted Backup and toggle the option on. This backup requires a separate password, which you should ideally create and store in a\u00a0password manager. If you lose this password, you won\u2019t be able to get into your encrypted backup. You should be\u00a0using two-factor authentication as much as possible\u2014it\u2019s even more important on accounts that hold your sensitive personal information, such as photos and messages. The security method involves adding an extra step to the process when you log in to an account. In most cases, this involves using a security code generated by an app, a code sent via SMS, or\u00a0a physical security key. (The last of these is the most secure way to protect your accounts with two-factor authentication\u2014and SMS is arguably the least secure of the three options.) Using WhatsApp is different from logging in to your email. It\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll access the app multiple times a day\u2014on average, I open the app between 50 and 80 times per day. Entering a security code every time this happens would be impractical and frustrating. So instead, WhatsApp\u2019s two-factor authentication, which can be turned on through the Settings menu and then by tapping on Account, uses a PIN. WhatsApp will semi-regularly ask you to reenter the six-digit PIN you create to access the app. It doesn\u2019t say how often these prompts happen, but they\u2019re irregular enough not to be a barrier to using the app. The PIN will also be required anytime there is an attempt to add your number to a new phone or device. When you\u2019re setting the PIN, there\u2019s also the option to add an email address that can be used to reset the code if you forget it. Your messages don\u2019t have to live forever. It\u2019s possible to\u00a0turn on disappearing messages for when you want additional privacy or just don\u2019t need to keep what you\u2019re sent for years. There are two ways within\u00a0WhatsApp to use self-destructing messages: for every new chat you have, or on an individual conversation basis.\u00a0 To run on disappearing messages by default for new conversations, go to\u00a0Settings, Privacy, Default Message Timer, and pick how long you want messages to last for. There are three options if you turn the setting on: 24 hours, 7 days, or 90 days. For an existing individual conversation or group chat,\u00a0open that chat,\u00a0tap the person\u2019s name at the top of the screen, select\u00a0Disappearing Messages, and then pick 24 hours, 7 days, 90 days, or Off. You may then have to tap to confirm this. Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff While turning on disappearing messages will give you some more privacy, it\u2019s worth remembering that whoever you message could still screenshot or take a photograph of what\u2019s on the screen. In addition to disappearing messages, you can also set photos and views to View Once. This\u2014rather unsurprisingly\u2014behaves exactly how it is described: The message can only opened one time and you can't go back to it once it's closed. When sending a photo or video, tap the icon that is contained within a partial circle. If you send a one-time image or video,\u00a0people cannot screenshot it. There are inevitably times when you need to hand your phone to someone else\u2014so your children can play games, for instance, or to show a friend a photo. WhatsApp has two features that can help protect your message if your phone falls into someone else\u2019s hands. First, you can turn on Screen Lock, which keeps the app locked unless you open it with Apple\u2019s Face ID or other biometrics on Android devices. To turn it on, go to\u00a0Settings,\u00a0Privacy, and select\u00a0Screen Lock. You\u2019ll need to set up the biometric options\u00a0before you turn the app lock on. You can also lock down individual chats on your phone. This means that to send messages to\u00a0locked chats, you\u2019ll need to use your phone\u2019s passcode, or your face or fingerprint to open up the chats and even see notifications from them. To turn it on, tap on a chat and the person\u2019s name, go to\u00a0Chat lock, and select the option to\u00a0lock the chat. This will move the chat into a new folder that can be accessed by\u00a0swiping down on the Chats tab. If you\u2019re going for the most private approach, it\u2019s also worth considering that any message that pops up could reveal private information. New message notifications can include the entire message or just some of its content when they flash up on your screen. If these notifications also sit unread, anyone picking up your device may be able to read them without having to unlock the phone. These options can be tweaked in\u00a0Settings, Notifications, and Show Preview. While WhatsApp\u2019s end-to-end encryption stops law enforcement, internet providers, and even Meta from seeing what you are sending, there are still some additional steps you can take to increase your privacy on your phone and reduce the chances of your number being targeted by spammers or scammers. Because WhatsApp is so popular, it\u2019s regularly the target of social engineering attacks, devised to steal your personal information.\u00a0 The ways to limit the ways people can interact with your account are all found through\u00a0Settings, followed by tapping on\u00a0Privacy. At the most simple, you can tap to turn off read receipts, the two blue ticks that show when someone has seen your message.\u00a0 More effective are the steps that stop people from adding you to groups. Under the\u00a0Groups setting, there is the option to limit who can add you to a group. By default, this is set as \u201ceveryone.\u201d However, it can be changed to\u00a0My Contacts, or\u00a0My Contacts Except\u2026,\u00a0allowing some exceptions. Deciding to limit who can add you to groups doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t join groups when people aren\u2019t in your contacts. Instead, people wanting to add you to groups can request to do so via a separate message. Within\u00a0Privacy,\u00a0you can also turn off who can see when you last looked at WhatsApp and when you were last online, who can see your profile photo, the About section, and WhatsApp Status. While in the privacy settings, you should also check whether you are sharing your live location with anyone. If you\u2019re looking for more privacy, switching messaging apps is a big upheaval but could be worth the time and effort. As mentioned earlier, our preference for combining end-to-end encryption with greater levels of privacy is Signal.
