To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Laura Cole This wasn\u2019t Supposed to happen. In 2020, in a house surrounded by fields in the Irish countryside, Liam, 19, sat at his laptop, an energy drink fizzing at his elbow. He leaned in for a better look at the profile photo and, sure enough, saw the face of an old rugby friend looking back at him. Just weeks earlier, Liam, whose name\u00a0has\u00a0been changed to protect his privacy, had been living in Waterford, in Southeast Ireland, about to start his second year at university. Then Covid-19 shut down the city and his university\u2019s campus. On any Saturday on the main street, there were now more pigeons than people. Pubs and caf\u00e9s shut their doors, and job opportunities dried up. \u201cMoney-wise it was worrying,\u201d he says. Increasingly concerned, Liam responded to a Facebook ad for a \u201cfreelance customer support representative,\u201d working remotely for vDesk, a company based in Cyprus. He was invited to an online interview. At the end of the call, the interviewer asked how he would feel about moderating dating websites. \u201cI thought I might be moderating hateful content on Tinder, something like that,\u201d he says, \u201cthey weren\u2019t clear about the kind of work it would really be.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before he found out. Rather than moderating content, Liam was asked to adopt fake online personas\u2014known as\u00a0\u201cvirtuals\u201d\u2014in order to chat to customers, most of them men looking for relationships or casual sex. Using detailed profiles of customers and well-crafted virtuals, Liam was expected to lure people into paying, message by message, for conversations with fictional characters. This is how, while pretending to be Anna2001, he found himself staring at an old acquaintance. But, he thought, hands slack on the keyboard, he needed the money. So for the next two minutes, he played the role he was paid to. Liam is one of hundreds\u00a0of freelancers employed all over the world to animate fake profiles and chat with people who have signed up for dating and hookup sites. WIRED\u00a0spoke to dozens of people working in the industry, people who had worked for months at a time at two of the companies involved in the creation of virtual profiles. vDesk didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Often recruited into \u201ccustomer support\u201d or content moderation roles, they found themselves playing roles in sophisticated operations set up to tease subscription money from lonely hearts looking for connections online. In a kitchen in Mexico, more than 8,000 kilometers away from Liam\u2019s house in Ireland, Alice faced a similar dilemma. She circled her cursor in frustration over a profile of someone she knew from her hometown in France. His chat history had all of his personal details: his name, city, job, past marriages. His kids\u2019 names and ages. For nearly two years, he had been talking to a virtual. He says he\u2019s in love with her. Alice\u2014whose name has also been changed to protect her privacy\u2014was next in line to inhabit that virtual. \u201cI could tell him,\u201d she thought, \u201cand I really should.\u201d Like Liam, Alice had responded to a job ad for vDesk during the pandemic. The position was for a \u201cfreelance remote translator.\u201d Alice, stuck in Mexico with no\u00a0way to make rent and no way back to France, went for it. \u201cI even sent them a long cover letter, detailing my skills in translating,\u201d she says dryly, \u201chow embarrassing.\u201d Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff Once she got over the realization\u2014on her first day working for the company\u2014that translating really meant \u201cflirting through fake profiles,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by how detailed the virtuals are. \u201cThe fakes don\u2019t seem like obviously unattainable women, they are eerily convincing and hyper-specific,\u201d she says. \u201cCustomer service\u201d staff\u00a0don\u2019t play a single character on the sites. Instead, they sit in a chat queue to be cycled between virtuals who they occupy for two minutes at a time. They are given a biography of the virtual. One, seen by WIRED, looks like this: Andrea667 (45), lonely divorcee looking for a man Home: Chesham Bois - 3 bed House with her kids Job: Owner of a makeup & beauty products shop in Watford 10-6pm, Mon-Sat Food/Drinks: pub lunch, lamb jalfrezi, strong Brazilian coffee Child 1: Ben - 15 (2006) Child 2: Annie - 12 (2009) It continues in more granular detail, her parents\u2019 names, her car (a Honda Civic automatic). On the right side of the moderator\u2019s screen is a cache of photos that can be drip-fed into the conversation. Another former freelancer\u00a0for vDesk, who was hired to create profiles in a country in Eastern Europe (to protect her privacy, WIRED is also not naming the country), says she was asked to divide her city into economic zones to make the profiles more believable. \u201cIt has to make sense,\u201d she says, \u201cif you had a banking executive living in, say, a students\u2019 area it would seem suspicious.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure where the photos used to illustrate the profiles were coming from. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it,\u201d she says, describing the work as \u201clike making Sims characters.\u201d (A reverse-image search on some of the images seen by WIRED show that at least some are grabbed from pornography sites.) To ease her conscience, she told all the people she knew in that city\u2014\u201ceven though you\u2019re supposed to be discreet about the job.\u201d Don\u2019t use these websites, she told her friends, \u201cI\u2019ve created them, and they are all fake.\u201d Moderators are encouraged to send 30 messages an hour. For two minutes, Alice says, that means you\u2019re \u201ca distinguished woman with multiple postgraduate degrees,\u201d then for the next two minutes you\u2019re \u201ca teenage girl with crazy interests.\u201d The freelancers have to be thorough. \u201cYou have to stay alert to weather and news in the fake\u2019s location,\u201d says Alice, \u201cso you can pretend you are a person you are not.\u201d Liam puts it more bluntly: \u201cYou have to be prepared to fuck with people\u2019s feelings.\u201d Employees are not told where the customers come from. External online portals promising anything from romantic dates to extreme fantasies funnel users into the same pool of \u201ccustomer service\u201d freelancers. \u201cYou feel bad because some of them are genuinely on there to find someone to date,\u201d says one ex-freelancer from France. Others are brought in by \u201caffiliate\u201d freelancers who use the virtuals to directly email potential users. According to the guidelines\u00a0Alice received, users who have been lured like this might start up the conversation on the site with \u201chi, I\u2019m here like you asked.\u201d Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff Most of the users gain access to the dating sites by buying \u201ccoins.\u201d The smallest costs \u20ac10 ($10.90), the largest \u20ac800. Overall, the user pays roughly \u20ac2 per message to a virtual. The sites collect detailed information about users, building profiles that help the freelancers maintain the fiction. These contain their living arrangements, details about their family and marital status (\u201csingle after two failed marriages,\u201d one read), and other personal details. \u201cIt will add their kids\u2019 names and ages, when they tell us them,\u201d Alice says, \u201cif they have been to therapy recently, what they have been feeling\u2014anything which can be used by the virtual to keep a sense of real connection.\u201d Failing to catch such details or to log near plans\u2014\u201ca trip, an exhibition, an appointment,\u201d the freelancers\u2019 guidelines say, can result in a reprimand from management. It is not clear what the company does with such data should the user terminate their profile. The guidelines given to Alice, which WIRED has examined, forbid copy-pasting and \u201csabotage\u201d\u2014meaning any acknowledgement that virtuals are fake, or mentioning the chat queue. Once a user is hooked in the conversation, the aim is always to stretch out the talking phase. \u201cIf a New York user asks to meet up with your virtual, the freelancer is to say\u00a0\u2018let me check my schedule and let you know,\u2019\u201d says Liam, even if you are writing from Budapest. If the user asks to move off to a free messaging app, the freelancers must write through the virtuals \u201cI prefer to stay in here until I know you better\u201d or \u201cI feel safer on this app until we are better acquainted,\u201d and so on. Alice says she saw chats where users said they had bought expensive gifts, \u201cnevermind the weeks of money they had spent talking to the virtuals.\u201d She spoke to elderly users in care homes, and others under protective conservatorships who asked virtuals to wait until they were given their next allowance. \u201cI think a lot of the users are vulnerable enough to believe it is real,\u201d she says. One morning, Alice opened her chat to a new message: \u201cPlease stop talking to my husband, he is spending money we do not have to talk to you,\u201d read the chat line. \u201cHow would you respond to that?\u201d asks Alice, \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop it.\u201d Freelance workers cannot shut down a conversation themselves, she says. Besides, even if it is a spouse, they are still paying per message\u2014\u201cand we only get paid if we respond in a way that provokes another one.\u201d WIRED discussed vDesk\u2019s business model with Volkan Topalli and Fangzhou Wang, who research romance fraud and criminology at Georgia State University\u2019s evidence-based cyber security research group. \u201cIt\u2019s possible this falls under romance scamming, what do you think?\u201d Topalli says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but wow the system is efficient,\u201d says Wang, \u201cin any case, it\u2019s like the owners are trying to cover their backs with the T&Cs.\u201d The niche dating portals, which have names like Snap-Date, Horny-Spot, SexDater, Discreet-Meets, Only-Flirts.com, PassionsLove, and BeeMyPair, funnel users into the system and usually include lengthy terms and conditions. Most of them say\u00a0something along the lines of\u00a0\u201cwe may use system profiles at our discretion to communicate with users to enhance our users\u2019 entertainment experience.\u201d According to Topalli, the language is ambiguous enough that it might let people think \u201chey, maybe I\u2019m talking to a pornstar,\u201d or that maybe only a small number of them are fakes. Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff Most of the sites are run by larger companies called Meet Us Media and Take Two Digital. Neither responded to requests for comment. At Georgia State University, Topalli and Wang research the toll of romance scams, the kind where individual perpetrators use popular free dating apps to scam large sums of money from victims that they groom, sometimes for years. For the \u201cmoderator\u201d companies Alice and Liam worked for, \u201cthere\u2019s deception here, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d says Wang. But unlike typical romance fraud, the transactions take place within the vague contractual agreements of the dating portals. Payments made by the users are limited to batch \u201ccoin\u201d subscriptions within these sites, rather than through requests for grand payouts to cover fabricated crises, such as flight tickets or bailouts or fake medical emergencies. \u201cThrough this system, they ask a wider pool of people for a smaller amount of money,\u201d says Wang, \u201cthough of course this could amount to large amounts for individuals over years of talking.\u201d For Topalli, these companies are operating in a legal gray area. What they are doing may well be legal, he says, but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean they are not completely unethical and immoral.\u201d While sex chat and call lines have been around forever, there is generally a mutual understanding that these are fee-for-service arrangements. If users are instead wooed by ads offering a real dating application and then freelancers are paid to continue this charade, \u201cit constitutes real deception,\u201d he says, \u201cand arguably exploitation on both sides of the internet\u2014both the victims and the workers.\u201d Freelancers working in the industry say they make a fraction of the money users are paying. Workers earn around 7 cents per message, or \u20ac2 an hour. For the company where Liam freelanced, the shifts were six hours a day, six days a week, \u201cand they want you to be active on screen all that time\u2014no breaks,\u201d he says. The 36-hour weeks got him around \u20ac400 a month. \u201cIt was a pittance,\u201d he says. In the murky, anonymous, globally dispersed industry, even some of the freelancers aren\u2019t who they say they are\u2014and are working for even less. In Lagos, 22-year-old physics student Idris\u2014who asked for anonymity to protect his privacy, started working for\u00a0Cloudworkers, a Swiss company, in June 2020\u00a0. The company doesn\u2019t actually hire people in Nigeria, so he has to sublet an account from someone else. He gets 40 percent of the fee paid to the account\u2019s owner. Cloudworkers didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. While illegal and not endorsed by the customer service companies, black market subletting is common in the industry. A scroll through Facebook groups dedicated to subcontracting (subcon) chat work finds hundreds of similar requests for people looking to rent accounts\u2014\u201cWe make a deal 40/60, I can produce 200 to 400 quality messages daily\u201d\u2014and established moderators selling them\u2014\u201clooking for a moderator for my account with experience, good grammar and knows how to follow rules.\u201d The companies are known to block accounts suddenly for suspected subcon work. The same Facebook groups are full of questions such as, \u201canyone else having trouble logging in?\u201d\u00a0met with comments of \u201cuh-oh, you\u2019ve been blocked.\u201d Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff Idris works on his phone six hours a night for about 400 Naira (87\u00a2) an hour.\u201d While he chats, he pretends to be the owner of the account, who is pretending to be a woman in the United States, who is pretending to be hundreds of virtual women. For Idris, it\u2019s difficult to see how anyone from high-income countries could make a living operating freelance profiles. \u201cThe pay is so terrible,\u201d says Idris from his bedroom in Lagos, \u201cit only makes sense if you are doing it from a country like Nigeria or the Philippines, and only then if you are desperate.\u201d Topalli says there\u2019s an inevitability to the scaling up of this industry, where a combination of an increasingly atomized remote workforce, the rise of gig work, and the number of people turning to the internet for connection has turned a cottage industry of deception into a production line. \u201cThe internet has made this possible,\u201d says Topalli. \u201cTechnology exponentiates a romance scam that used to happen face-to-face to unprecedented, global dimensions.\u201d On Facebook and Twitter, the moderation companies continue to advertise new roles. Alice and Liam have both left the industry. After Liam saw his old friend in the chat, he messaged his team leader. \u201cCould I take a moment off? To process it?\u201d A wait. An ellipsis icon rolled. \u201cIt would be better if you went back to work.\u201d Liam handed in his notice not long after. By then, he\u2019d seen users talking to the virtuals about their heaviest emotional concerns: \u201cone was talking about suicide and how the fake woman had saved him from it, now that he\u2019d found love.\u201d Liam had seen marriage proposals from users, some who had been on there as long as four and a half years. \u201cAnd how can you blame them,\u201d says Liam, \u201cwhen the system is doing its best to get to know you as well as it can?\u201d \ud83d\udce7 Get the best stories from WIRED\u2019s iconic archive in your inbox \ud83c\udfa7 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Where to find the energy to save the world This fanfic sex trope caught a plundering AI red-handed \u201cCash stuffing\u201d is thriving on TikTok The surprising synergy between acupuncture and AI Why suicide rates are dropping around the world \u26fa Embrace the new season with the Gear team\u2019s best picks for best tents, umbrellas, and robot vacuums Chris Stokel-Walker Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Steven Levy Will Knight Tracy Wen Liu Matt Burgess Will Knight More From WIRED Contact \u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
