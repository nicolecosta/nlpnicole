We\u2019re now churning out a\u00a0trillion pounds of it a year\u2014an altogether more stunning figure when you consider that the material is ultra-lightweight by design.\u00a0Less than 10 percent of that is recycled, while the rest ends up in landfills, leaks into the environment, or is burned. And that dysfunctional relationship is getting exponentially worse, as plastic production could triple by 2060.\u00a0 The problem is massive, demoralizing, and ostensibly impossible to fix. But today the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is dropping an urgent report on the extraordinary environmental and human costs of plastic pollution, along with a\u00a0road map for the world to take action. With several strategies working in concert\u2014like production cuts and more reuse of plastic products\u2014the report finds that humanity might reduce that pollution 80 percent by 2040. The road map lands just weeks ahead of the second round of negotiations for an\u00a0international treaty on plastics, which scientists and antipollution groups are hoping results in a\u00a0significant cap on production. The report emphasizes the devastating price of our civilization\u2019s addiction to plastic, \u201cparticularly when it comes to human health costs of plastics\u2014so endocrine disruption, cognitive impairments, cancers,\u201d says Steven Stone, deputy director of the Industry and Economy Division at the UNEP and a lead author of the report. \u201cWhen you take those along with the cleanup costs of plastic pollution, you get in the range of $300 billion to $600 billion a year. This report is a message of hope\u2014we are not doomed to incurring all of these costs.\u201d In fact, the report notes, with action on plastic pollution, we might avoid $4.5 trillion in costs by 2040. This road map builds on another\u00a0alarming report the UNEP released earlier this month, which found that of the 13,000 known chemicals associated with plastics and their production, at least 3,200 have one or more hazardous properties of concern. Ten groups of these chemicals are of\u00a0major concern, such as PFAS and phthalates. Of particular toxicity are a wide range of chemicals in plastics with endocrine-disrupting properties, which\u00a0short-circuit the hormone system even in very low doses, leading to\u00a0obesity,\u00a0cancer, and other diseases. \u201cThere are these costs that are going to manifest in human health, in environmental destruction, in marine litter pollution,\u201d Stone says. \u201cThose are costs that fall on everyone. But the consumer of plastic doesn\u2019t take pay for it, neither does the producer. So that\u2019s a massive market failure.\u201d Plastic is, at the end of the day, a highly toxic material that\u2019s infiltrated every aspect of our daily lives. The goal above all others should be to stop manufacturing so much of the stuff, so the new road map calls for eliminating unnecessary plastics, like the single-use variety.\u00a0 But the challenge is that plastic remains absurdly cheap to produce\u2014its many external costs be damned. \u201cThis road map is headed in the right direction but must go much further to curb new plastics production,\u201d says Dianna Cohen, CEO and cofounder of Plastic Pollution Coalition. \u201cWe are glad to see an emphasis on reduction and reuse, which are key elements of solutions to plastic pollution, as these actions can most rapidly help us diminish plastic production. Missing in the report is requiring industrial/corporate entities that produce material items to stop making more toxic fossil-fuel plastic, full stop.\u201d Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff In addition to reducing production, the report argues, the world must improve recycling systems, which alone could reduce plastic pollution 20 percent by 2040. But recycling in its current form is problematic for a number of reasons. For one, the recycling rate in the United States is now just\u00a05 percent of plastic waste. The US and other developed nations have\u00a0long shipped millions upon millions of pounds of the plastic waste they can\u2019t profitably recycle to developing countries, where bottles and bags and wrappers are often burned in open pits or escape into the environment.\u00a0 A core issue is that over the years, plastic products have gotten much more complicated and therefore much less recyclable: Nowadays, food pouches might have layers of different polymers, or a product might be half plastic, half paper. \u201cBy agreeing and then imposing design rules that allow, for instance, a\u00a0limited number of polymers or a limited number of chemical additives that play well within the system, that already improves heavily the economics of recycling,\u201d says Lloren\u00e7 Mil\u00e0 i Canals, head of secretariat of the Life Cycle Initiative at the UNEP and lead coordinator of the report. \u201cThat makes recycling much more profitable because it will take much less to bring those materials back into the economy.\u201d However, even recycling that\u2019s done properly comes at a huge environmental cost: A study published earlier this month found that a single facility might emit\u00a03 million pounds of microplastic a year in its wastewater, which flows into the environment. The upside, at least, is that the facility would have released 6.5 million pounds of microplastic had it not installed filters, so there\u2019s at least a way to mitigate that pollution. But\u00a0these\u00a0tiny\u00a0particles have now corrupted the entirety of the planet, including a broad\u00a0range of\u00a0organisms. And generally speaking, as plastics production is increasing exponentially,\u00a0microplastic pollution is increasing in lockstep.\u00a0 In that sense, then, recycling is making the plastic pollution problem worse. \u201cPlastic was not designed to be recycled, and recycling it only reintroduces toxic chemicals and microplastics into the environment and our bodies,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cThe [UNEP] report\u2019s authors even go so far to acknowledge that even if it is achievable, a circular economy of plastics would be decades in the making, and even under the best scenario, following the road map as outlined would lead to approximately 136 million metric tons of plastic flowing into landfills, incinerators, and the environment to cause pollution in the year 2040. That is an enormous\u2014and unacceptable\u2014amount of plastic.\u201d Really, recycling allows the plastics industry to keep making all the plastic it wants, under the guise of sustainability. \u201cIf you had an overflowing bathtub, you wouldn\u2019t just run for the mop first\u2014you turn off the tap,\u201d says Jacqueline Savitz, chief policy officer for the conservation nonprofit Oceana, who wasn\u2019t involved in the report. \u201cRecycling is the mop.\u201d Another strategy highlighted in the new report is \u201cextended producer responsibility,\u201d in which manufacturers don\u2019t just make the stuff and wipe their hands of it. The plastics industry has long promoted recycling (even though\u00a0it has known that the current system doesn\u2019t work) because it makes you, the \u201ccareless\u201d consumer, responsible for pollution. Extended producer responsibility puts the burden back on the industry, forcing producers to, say, implement systems to take bottles back and reuse them. Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Rose Eveleth WIRED Staff Additionally, the new report notes, countries might\u00a0impose a tax on plastic, which would make it more expensive for manufacturers to churn out virgin plastic. Governments would then use that money to fund recycling programs and other mitigation measures to reduce plastic pollution. \u201cThe costs that are externalized to society are actually put up front,\u201d says Stone. \u201cAnd then recycled materials are much more competitive with the virgin materials. That will be a tremendous benefit for keeping plastics in play longer.\u201d Another way to keep plastics in circulation is to encourage reuse. So instead of having to recycle a single-use water bottle, ideally people would have their own reusable bottles to fill over and over. Instead of buying shampoo in a plastic bottle each time, people might visit\u00a0refill stores. Combined, such reuse initiatives could reduce plastic pollution by 30 percent, the new report finds. \u201cIt does require systems and investment, but it has the potential to be a big economic opportunity,\u201d says Savitz, of Oceana. \u201cNew companies could start out small but could end up being sort of the Amazon of reuse.\u201d Finally, the report calls for a \u201ccareful replacement\u201d of certain plastic products\u2014using paper or compostable materials instead, for instance. \u201cCareful\u201d meaning we wouldn\u2019t want to widely deploy some sort of plastic alternative that ends up being just as toxic. This is already a problem, as plastics producers swap out known toxic chemicals, like bisphenol A (aka BPA), for similar chemicals that\u00a0may be just as toxic, if not more so\u2014a \u201cregrettable substitution,\u201d as scientists call it. The good news, at least, is that plastic pollution is finally being elevated to emergency status in the international community. \u201cThe fact that there is consensus that this is an issue by all countries, to me means we have a tremendous opportunity,\u201d says Stone. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to get the science out there so that people can see the numbers and understand what the stakes are right now. Because plastics pollution is a time bomb, essentially, and we need to deal with it now.\u201d \ud83d\udce9 Don\u2019t miss our biggest stories, delivered to your inbox every day \ud83c\udfa7 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future Reality TV saved me The team of sleuths hunting cyberattack-for-hire services Self-driving cars are being put on a data diet Google doesn\u2019t need you to buy its folding phone Your dog is a secret weapon in the fight against cancer \ud83d\udd0a Our Gear team sounds off on audiophile-grade speakers, vinyl accessories and the best wireless headphones for anyone Rhett Allain Ramin Skibba Ramin Skibba Maggie Chen  Ramin Skibba Max G.
