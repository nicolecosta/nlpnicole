{"title": "Visual Layer helps enterprise manage the massive visual data sets they need to build AI models, raises $7M | TechCrunch", "content": "Training machine learning models for computer vision use cases takes massive amounts of images. Often, those images are mislabeled, broken or duplicated, leading to sub-par model performance. But with millions of images in many datasets, it\u2019s virtually impossible to catch these issues. Visual Layer, a Tel Aviv-based startup that wants to enable data scientists and ML engineers to find these issues before they impact their models, today announced that it has raised a $7 million seed funding round led by Madrona and Insight Partners. The company built a system that, without relying on expensive GPUs, can analyze hundreds of millions of images and automatically find potential issues within these data sets. At the core of Visual Layer\u2019s technology stack is the open-source fastdub project.\u00a0 The company\u2019s co-founders Danny Bickson (CEO) and Amir Alush (CTO) developed this project based on their experience at companies like Apple, where Bickson was previously a Str Data Science Manager of the company acquired the AI startup Turi (which he co-founded), and Brodmann17, which Alush co-founded. Fastdup, which recently hit version 1.0, helps engineers find potential issues in their image data sets, clusters and visualizes them.

Most datasets also include broken images or very similar images that have vastly different labels. Often, thousands of images are also simply mislabeled and are then being used to train the wrong model (think images of shoes being used to train a face detection model). \u201cCompanies and organizations across the globe are experiencing the explosion of data, and visual data is one of the most complex and challenging data types to manage. Understanding, curating and managing this content is crucially important to build meaningful services for customers in a broad set of industries \u2013 from retail to manufacturing to self-driving cars and more,\u201d said Bickson. \u201cCompanies are struggling with those huge amounts of data, they often have no clue where their data is and what is inside it. They develop their homegrown tools since there is no infrastructure and no common standards.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Visual Layer is essentially offering fastdub as a service (with additional enterprise features layered on top).

Now with the reality of large-scale AI models we must solve the data problem. The immediate excitement we saw after the launch of fastdup made clear to us that customers agree. We are excited to work with the Visual Layer team and the fastdup community to build a new, foundational component of the AI application stack,\u201d said Jon Turow, Partner at Madrona.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/16/visual-layer-helps-enterprise-manage-the-massive-visual-data-sets-they-need-to-build-ai-models-raises-7m/", "threshold": -0.9155708918238485}
