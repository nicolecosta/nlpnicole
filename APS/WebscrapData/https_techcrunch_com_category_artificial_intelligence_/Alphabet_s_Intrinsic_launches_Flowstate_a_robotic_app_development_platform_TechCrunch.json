{"title": "Alphabet\u2019s Intrinsic launches Flowstate, a robotic app development platform | TechCrunch", "content": "The hottest corner of the robotic space right now isn\u2019t the robots themselves. Those companies have done an excellent job getting their systems out into places like warehouses and factories, but the broader question of actually managing and programming them is a bit fuzzier. Proprietary software for these robotics systems is generally difficult to develop for and won\u2019t work with third-party systems. When it was announced back in 2021, Alphabet X graduate Intrinsic offered the following insight into its plans: Over the last few years, our team has been exploring how to give industrial robots the ability to sense, learn, and automatically make adjustments as they\u2019re completing tasks, so they work in a wider range of settings and applications. Working in collaboration with teams across Alphabet, and with our partners in real-world manufacturing settings, we\u2019ve been testing software that uses techniques like automated perception, deep learning, reinforcement learning, motion planning, simulation, and force control. This morning, the company announced its first product, Flowstate, a development platform designed to deliver on some of those promises. The software is designed to help non-roboticists develop workflows for these hardware systems. \u201cOur first product is a solution builder,\u201d CEO Wendy Tan White tells TechCrunch. \u201cWith Intrisic Flowstate, what we\u2019re saying is: you can design it, build it and deploy it. We\u2019re very aware the world is still early in the skills available. They can be put together in this workflow that we\u2019re offering. We\u2019re also going to allow [third-party] skills to be available, too. We want the broader ecosystem to start to be involved. One of the advantages of coming out of Alphabet is some of the more sophisticated skills like vision and force feedback where you require some machine learning or even deep reinforcement learning. We\u2019ve been able to create some of those skills as well. What you\u2019ll find in flow state is not just the solution builder itself, but a library of skills, some of which don\u2019t exist or are not easy to access today.\u201d At the core of the system is a graphical tree that allows users to string together more complex workflows. Existing skills include pose estimation, manipulation, force-based insertion and path planning. The platform will also be opened to third-party developers who can design their own skills to be integrated into flows.

It\u2019s the key most robotics deployments these days, affording users the ability to run scenarios simultaneously in a virtual world to determine real-world outcomes. The platform uses Gazebo, an open-source platform stewarded by Open Robotics, which also managed the robotic operating system, ROS. The connected for-profit arm, Open Source Robotics Corporation, was acquired by Intrinsic last December. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done with the acquisition is the core engineering team that used to work under OSRF (Open Source Robotics Foundation) is now working at Intrinsic,\u201d says Brian Gerkey, the Open Robotics CEO who now serves as the director of Open Robotics at Intrinsic. \u201cYou should think of Intrinsic as perhaps one of the more important, but really just one player within the ROS ecosystem. We happen to employ a bunch of engineers and we\u2019ve committed to supporting them to develop and contribute back to the ROS community.\u201d The news follows a massive round of layoffs felt across Alphabet, including Every Day Robotics. \u201cThe EDR (Every Day Robotics) team has moved in with what became (Google) Brain,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat product has merged with Google Deep Mind. We were working a lot with DeepMind already. The fully integrated Google DeepMind team fully intends to help us build more skills, including ones that would have been used with EDR potentially.\u201d Tan White says that in spite of a 40-person reduction of Intrinsic\u2019s workforce, the company wasn\u2019t majorly impacted by layoffs. Rather, she explains, the shakeups were part of a small pivot within the company. \u201cWe made some specific layoffs,\u201d she says. \u201cWe graduated and we\u2019ve actually made a couple of acquisitions. We were getting clear on what this project was. There were a couple of projects that were more hardware based, and we made a choice to not focus on that. That\u2019s what the layoffs were actually about. It was to focus on the software and the AI part of what we\u2019re doing and that first product. I think what confused the external world at that time is we were obviously doing the acquisition with Open Robotics. They were related in the sense that we\u2019ve decided we want to be software focused, which is where Open Robotics fit in really well.\u201d The company also acquired Vicarious in April of last year. Tan White says around 80% of that team is currently still working for Intrinsic. \u201cTheir expertise in certain applications has been critical,\u201d she adds. \u201cSome of the applications you\u2019re going to see in the skills we have are based on the Vicarious Code.\u201d Flowstate is now available as a beta. Intrinsic says it had more than 100 signups in the first hour of going live.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/15/alphabets-intrinsic-launches-flowstate-a-robotic-app-development-platform/", "threshold": 0.9829636976811522}
