{"title": "Personal CRM app Clay introduces an AI helper to help you navigate your relationships | TechCrunch", "content": "Clay, a startup that\u2019s something of a personal CRM, as it\u2019s designed to help people manage their own relationships \u2014 including those with friends, family, colleagues, industry peers and more \u2014 is now turning to AI to help you derive more insights from your network of contacts. If you ever wanted to ask an AI \u00a0who among your connections has ever been to a specific place, works a particular company, or is knowledgable about a particular topic, Clay\u2019s new AI navigator, which it\u2019s dubbed Nexus, could help. While many people today are using AI to summarize information from the web or answer questions about general topics, Nexus is putting AI to use for a more practical and personal purpose, while still respecting user privacy. Launched in 2021, Clay\u2019s first iteration offered a service that pulled in information from your address book and other social networks, like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, to build something that\u2019s more powerful than an address book but also not as sales-and-pipeline focused as a traditional CRM system. Instead, the company described its product as a \u201chome for your people,\u201d carving out a niche for a sort of personal relationship-focused database and contacts system. With Clay, you could also keep up with your colleagues and friends\u2019 latest achievements, recent posts, and birthdays as well as jot down notes you wanted to remember \u2014 like how you met, when you last hung out, or what you talked about \u2014 and could organize contacts into groups. Combined, the features allowed you to be more thoughtful and conscientious about your relationships, which could aid with anything from growing your network to just being a better friends. Now, the new AI-powered Nexus feature will allow you to query against your personal database to learn even more about your network and aid you with maintaining your relationships.

I think a lot of a lot of what we\u2019re seeing is technology and search for solution,\u201d says Clay co-founder Matthew Achariam.\u00a0Prior to Clay, Achariam led product at Y Combinator-backed analytics company Castora. He\u2019s joined on Clay by co-foudner\u00a0Zachary Hamed, who previously product management for Goldman Sachs\u2019 Marquee. \u201cWhen we first started Clay, one of the first things that we really wanted to get right was actually people search\u2026we said, it\u2019s fundamentally broken because all your data is everywhere, and there\u2019s just too much of it,\u201d Achariam explains. \u201cSo, we were jumping for joy when we first heard about the advancements in AI because now you can essentially have your network be this living, portable thing that you need some help navigating.\u201d Image Credits: Clay Image Credits: Clay The company spent the last year working to develop their AI functionality in order to build a tool that\u2019s designed specifically for this purpose, using a combination of technologies from OpenAI, Anthropic and self-trained models from Hugging Face and other open source technologies to create a hybrid model for its own purposes. The result is Nexus, which allows you to query your own network for insights. For example, you could ask Nexus who to invite to a dinner party in New York next week or who knows a lot about chip manufacturing among your connections. Or, as Achariam describes it, it\u2019s like talking to your network as if it\u2019s a person, then having it generate a list for you, based on its understanding of that data. The AI helper can also assist with relationship-building, as it can help you to do things like compose an email to a contact to suggest you catch up soon, for instance. Or it could suggest gift ideas when it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday. Image Credits: Clay Image Credits: Clay Given the sensitivity of the information in your network, Clay has always been upfront with how it respects user privacy and security, offering a human-readable privacy policy where it tends to default to the most restrictive policy possible for all its integrations. For instance, it doesn\u2019t pull email bodies, only metadata like the subject line and recipients. And it\u2019s explicit about what it does and does not collect, forgoing working with third-party providers that use data for training purposes, and ensuring everything is opt-in, not opt out. (Plus, if you later opt out, the information is deleted.) \u201cBeing the the processing layer for this data and you being able to trust us means that we\u2019re not giving, for example, all of the data to OpenAI or any of these other companies. We can be very specific about the data that we use, how we use it, and what is the question it\u2019s answering,\u201d notes Hamed. We should note that, like other companies, Clay\u2019s access to Twitter via APIs has deteriorated since Elon Musk\u2019s policy changes. The company says, however, if existing users had connected with Twitter in the past, that data should still be available. Image Credits: Clay Image Credits: Clay Clay doesn\u2019t share how many users are now using its app, which is now available across Mac, Windows, web and iOS, and soon, Android. However, the founders did tell us that it\u2019s approaching over 100 million relationships managed, in terms of its network size. (That\u2019s not an equivalent to users, as each user could have thousands of people in their own network. But you can sort of back your way into a user estimate here, using averages.) The app itself is popular among a number of industries, ranging from MBA students early in their career where they\u2019re meeting a lot of people, to those who have expansive networks, like VCs. Some smaller business customers are also using Clay to develop better relationships with their best customers, but not for sales pipeline types of concerns. The startup also now offers tiered pricing, beginning with a free, personal plan with a more limited search history, and a Pro Plan ($20/mo) with unlimited search history. It says the new\u00a0AI features will roll out to both plans at no additional charge, as the team believes this will now become a big selling point for its app. \u201cWe wanted to get it in people\u2019s hands. We really believe that this is a unique use case for AI and we\u2019re the first people to do it in this \u2014 sort of, CRM, networking, contacts anything \u2014 space. So we wanted to give people a preview of what\u2019s to come,\u201d says Hamed. As the feature is currently in a technical preview, users will only be able to \u201crefresh\u201d their network\u2019s data for the AI use case once per month, but that will improve over time. Clay, still a small team of 14, is backed by a little over $8 million in seed funding from Forerunner Ventures, General Catalyst, and others. The company has seen inbound interest over its AI plans but hasn\u2019t committed to raising an additional round at this time.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/16/personal-crm-app-clay-introduces-an-ai-helper-to-help-you-navigate-your-relationships/", "threshold": 0.9952941428035222}
