{"title": "Search - Wikipedia", "content": " The Atacama Desert (Spanish: Desierto de Atacama) is a desert plateau located on the Pacific coast of South America. Stretching over a 1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi) strip of land west of the Andes Mountains, it covers an area of 105,000\u00a0km2 (41,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[2] which increases to 128,000\u00a0km2 (49,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) if the barren lower slopes of the Andes are included.[3] The terrain in predominantly stony, with salt lakes (salares), sand, and felsic lava that flows towards the Andes.[clarification needed] The Atacama Desert is the driest nonpolar desert in the world, and the second driest overall, behind some specific spots within the McMurdo Dry Valleys.[4][5][6][7] It is the only hot true desert to receive less precipitation than polar deserts, and the largest fog desert in the world. The area has been used as an experimentation site for Mars expedition simulations due to its similarities to the Martian environment. The constant temperature inversion caused by the cool north-flowing Humboldt ocean current and the strong Pacific anticyclone contribute to the extreme aridity of the desert.[8] The most arid region of the Atacama Desert is situated between two mountain chains, the Andes and the Chilean Coast Range, which are high enough to prevent moisture advection from either the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, creating a two-sided rain shadow effect.[9] According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Atacama Desert ecoregion occupies a continuous strip for nearly 1,600\u00a0km (1,000\u00a0mi) along the narrow coast of the northern third of Chile, from near Arica (18\u00b024\u2032S) southward to near La Serena (29\u00b055\u2032S).[10] The National Geographic Society considers the coastal area of southern Peru to be part of the Atacama Desert[11][12] and includes the deserts south of the Ica Region in Peru. However, other sources consider that the part of the desert in Peru is a different ecosystem, and should properly be named as Pampas de la Joya desert. Peru borders it on the north and the Chilean Matorral ecoregion borders it on the south. To the east lies the less arid Central Andean dry puna ecoregion. The drier portion of this ecoregion is located south of the Loa River between the parallel Sierra Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna and Cordillera Domeyko. To the north of the Loa lies the Pampa del Tamarugal. The Coastal Cliff of northern Chile west of the Chilean Coast Range is the main topographical feature of the coast.[13] The geomorphology of the Atacama Desert has been characterized as a low-relief bench \"similar to a giant uplifted terrace\" by Armijo and co-workers.[14] The intermediate depression (or Central Valley) forms a series of endorheic basins in much of the Atacama Desert south of latitude 19\u00b030'S. North of this latitude, the intermediate depression drains into the Pacific Ocean.[15] The almost total lack of precipitation is the most prominent characteristic of the Atacama Desert.[17] The Atacama Desert is commonly known as the driest place in the world, especially the surroundings of the abandoned Yungay mining town, where the University of Antofagasta Desert Research Station is located,[18][19] in Antofagasta Region, Chile.[20] The average rainfall is about 15\u00a0mm (0.6\u00a0in) per year,[21] although some locations only receive 1 to 3\u00a0mm (0.04 to 0.12\u00a0in) in a year.[22] Moreover, some weather stations in the Atacama have never received rain. Periods up to four years have been registered with no rainfall in the central sector, delimited by the cities of Antofagasta, Calama, and Copiap\u00f3, in Chile.[23] Evidence suggests that the Atacama may not have had any significant rainfall from 1570 to 1971.[2] The Atacama Desert may be the oldest desert on earth, and has experienced hyperaridity since at least the Middle Miocene, since the establishment of a proto-Humboldt current in conjunction with the opening of the Tasmania-Antarctic passage ca. 33 Ma.[24] The opening of the Tasmania-Antarctic passage allowed for cold currents to move along the west coast of South America, which influenced the availability of warm humid air to travel from the Amazon Basin to the Atacama. Though there was a general lack of humid air after 33 Ma, there were punctuated intervals of increased humidity,[25] such as between around 10.86 and 6.4 Ma, when the Tiliviche Palaeolake existed before turning into a salar sometime before the Middle Pliocene.[26] The long history of aridity raises the possibility that supergene mineralisation, under the appropriate conditions, can form in arid environments, instead of requiring humid conditions.[27] The presence of evaporite formations suggest that in some sections of the Atacama Desert, arid conditions have persisted for the last 200 million years (since the Triassic). The Atacama is so arid that many mountains higher than 6,000\u00a0m (20,000\u00a0ft) are completely free of glaciers. Only the highest peaks (such as Ojos del Salado, Monte Pissis, and Llullaillaco) have some permanent snow coverage. The southern part of the desert, between 25\u00b0 and 27\u00b0S, may have been glacier-free throughout the Quaternary (including during glaciations), though permafrost extends down to an altitude of 4,400\u00a0m (14,400\u00a0ft) and is continuous above 5,600\u00a0m (18,400\u00a0ft). Studies by a group of British scientists have suggested that some river beds have been dry for 120,000 years.[28] However, some locations in the Atacama receive a marine fog known locally as the camanchaca, providing sufficient moisture for hypolithic algae, lichens, and even some cacti\u2014the genus Copiapoa is notable among these. Geographically, the aridity of the Atacama is explained by its being situated between two mountain chains (the Andes and the Chilean Coast Range) of sufficient height to prevent moisture advection from either the Pacific or the Atlantic Oceans, a two-sided rain shadow.[9] Despite modern views of the Atacama Desert as fully devoid of vegetation, in pre-Columbian and colonial times a large flatland area there known as Pampa del Tamarugal was a woodland, but demand for firewood associated with silver and saltpeter mining in the 18th and 19th centuries resulted in widespread deforestation.[29][A] In a region about 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) south of Antofagasta, which averages 3,000\u00a0m (10,000\u00a0ft) in elevation, the soil has been compared to that of Mars. Owing to its otherworldly appearance, the Atacama has been used as a location for filming Mars scenes, most notably in the television series Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets. In 2003, a team of researchers published a report  in which they duplicated the tests used by the Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars landers to detect life and were unable to detect any signs in Atacama Desert soil in the region of Yungay.[19] The region may be unique on Earth in this regard and is being used by NASA to test instruments for future Mars missions. The team duplicated the Viking tests in Mars-like Earth environments and found that they missed present signs of life in soil samples from Antarctic dry valleys, the Atacama Desert of Chile and Peru, and other locales.However, in 2014, a new hyperarid site was reported, Mar\u00eda Elena South, which was much drier than Yungay and, thus, a better Mars-like environment.[31] Towards Atacama, near the deserted coast, you see a land without men, where there is not a bird, not a beast, nor a tree, nor any vegetation. La Araucana by Alonso de Ercilla, 1569[32] In 2008, the Phoenix Mars Lander detected perchlorates on the surface of Mars at the same site where water was first discovered.[33] Perchlorates are also found in the Atacama and associated nitrate deposits have contained organics, leading to speculation that signs of life on Mars are not incompatible with perchlorates. The Atacama is also a testing site for the NASA-funded Earth\u2013Mars Cave Detection Program.[34] On 21 February 2023, scientists reported the findings of a \"dark microbiome\" of unfamiliar microorganisms in the Atacama Desert.[35][36] In June 1991, Antofagasta and Taltal and inland regions as far as Calama received unusual rainfall leading to formation of a series of mudflows that killed 91 persons.[37][38][39] In 2012, the altiplano winter brought floods to San Pedro de Atacama.[40][41] On 25 March 2015, heavy rainfall affected the southern part of the Atacama Desert.[42][43] Resulting floods triggered mudflows that affected the cities of Copiapo, Tierra Amarilla, Chanaral, and Diego de Almagro, causing the deaths of more than 100 people. In spite of the geographic and climatic conditions of the desert, a rich variety of flora has evolved there. Over 500 species have been gathered within the border of this desert. These species are characterized by their extraordinary ability to adapt to this extreme environment.[44] The most common species are herbs and flowers such as thyme, llareta, and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and where humidity is sufficient, trees such as the cha\u00f1ar (Geoffroea decorticans), the pimiento tree, and the leafy algarrobo (Prosopis chilensis). The llareta is one of the highest-growing wood species in the world. It is found at altitudes between 3,000 and 5,000\u00a0m (9,800 and 16,400\u00a0ft). Its dense form is similar to a pillow some 3 to 4\u00a0m (9.8 to 13.1\u00a0ft) thick. It concentrates and retains the heat from the day to cope with low evening temperatures. The growth rate of the llareta has been recently estimated at about 1.5\u00a0cm/year (0.59\u00a0in/year), making many llaretas over 3,000 years old. It produces a much-prized resin, which the mining industry once harvested indiscriminately as fuel, making this plant endangered. The desert is also home to cacti, succulents, and other plants that thrive in a dry climate. Cactus species here include the candelabro (Browningia candelaris) and cardon (Echinopsis atacamensis), which can reach a height of 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) and a diameter of 70\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in). The Atacama Desert flowering (Spanish: desierto florido) can be seen from September to November in years with sufficient precipitation, as happened in 2015.[42][43] The climate of the Atacama Desert limits the number of animals living permanently in this extreme ecosystem. Some parts of the desert are so arid, no plant or animal life can survive. Outside of these extreme areas, sand-colored grasshoppers blend with pebbles on the desert floor, and beetles and their larvae provide a valuable food source in the lomas (hills). Desert wasps and butterflies can be found during the warm and humid season, especially on the lomas. Red scorpions also live in the desert. A unique environment is provided by some lomas, where the fog from the ocean provides enough moisture for seasonal plants and a few animal species. Surprisingly few reptile species inhabit the desert and even fewer amphibian species. Chaunus atacamensis, the Vallenar toad or Atacama toad, lives on the lomas, where it lays eggs in permanent ponds or streams. Iguanians and lava lizards inhabit parts of the desert, while salt flat lizards, Liolaemus, live in the dry areas bordering the ocean.[45] One species, Liolaemus fabiani, is endemic to the Salar de Atacama, the Atacama salt flat.[46] Birds are one of the most diverse animal groups in the Atacama. Humboldt penguins live year-round along the coast, nesting in desert cliffs overlooking the ocean. Inland, high-altitude salt flats are inhabited by Andean flamingos, while Chilean flamingos can be seen along the coast. Other birds (including species of hummingbirds and rufous-collared sparrow) visit the lomas seasonally to feed on insects, nectar, seeds, and flowers. The lomas help sustain several threatened species, such as the endangered Chilean woodstar. Because of the desert's extreme aridity, only a few specially adapted mammal species live in the Atacama, such as Darwin's leaf-eared mouse. The less arid parts of the desert are inhabited by the South American gray fox and the viscacha (a relative of the chinchilla). Larger animals, such as guanacos and vicu\u00f1as, graze in areas where grass grows, mainly because it is seasonally irrigated by melted snow. Vicu\u00f1as need to remain near a steady water supply, while guanacos can roam into more arid areas and survive longer without fresh water. South American fur seals and South American sea lions often gather along the coast. The Atacama is sparsely populated, with most towns located along the Pacific coast.[47] In interior areas, oases and some valleys have been populated for millennia and were the location of the most advanced pre-Columbian societies found in Chile.[citation needed] The Chinchorro culture developed in the Atacama Desert area from 7000 BCE to 1500 BCE. These peoples were sedentary fishermen inhabiting mostly coastal areas. Their presence is found from today's towns of Ilo, in southern Peru, to Antofagasta in northern Chile. Presence of fresh water in the arid region on the coast facilitated human settlement in these areas. The Chinchorro were famous for their detailed mummification and funerary practices.[48] San Pedro de Atacama, at about 2,400\u00a0m (8,000\u00a0ft) elevation, is like many of the small towns. Before the Inca Empire and prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the extremely arid interior was inhabited primarily by the Atacame\u00f1o tribe. They are noted for building fortified towns called pucar\u00e1s, one of which is located a few kilometers from San Pedro de Atacama. The town's church was built by the Spanish in 1577. The oasis settlement of Pica has Pre-hispanic origins and served as an important stopover for transit between the coast and the Altiplano during the time of the Inca Empire.[49] The coastal cities originated in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries during the time of the Spanish Empire, when they emerged as shipping ports for silver produced in Potos\u00ed and other mining centers. During the 19th century, the desert came under control of Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. With the discovery of sodium nitrate deposits and as a result of unclear borders, the area soon became a zone of conflict and resulted in the War of the Pacific. Chile annexed most of the desert, and cities along the coast developed into international ports, hosting many Chilean workers who migrated there.[50][51][52] With the guano and saltpeter booms of the 19th century, the population grew immensely, mostly as a result of immigration from central Chile. In the 20th century, the nitrate industry declined and at the same time, the largely male population of the desert became increasingly problematic for the Chilean state. Miners and mining companies came into conflict, and protests spread throughout the region. Around 1900, there were  irrigation system of puquios spread through the oases of Atacama Desert.[53] Puquios are known from the valleys of Azapa and Sibaya and the oases of La Calera, Pica-Matilla and Puquio de N\u00fa\u00f1ez.[53] In 1918, geologist Juan Br\u00fcggen mentioned the existence of 23 socavones (shafts) in the Pica oasis, yet these have since been abandoned due to economic and social changes.[53] The desert has rich deposits of copper and other minerals and the world's largest natural supply of sodium nitrate (Chile saltpeter), which was mined on a large scale until the early 1940s. The Atacama border dispute over these resources between Chile and Bolivia began in the 19th century and resulted in the War of the Pacific.[54] The desert is littered with about 170 abandoned nitrate (or \"saltpeter\") mining towns, almost all of which were shut down decades after the invention of synthetic nitrate in Germany in the first decade of the 20th century (see Haber process).[citation needed] The towns include Chacabuco, Humberstone, Santa Laura, Pedro de Valdivia, Puelma, Mar\u00eda Elena, and Oficina Anita.[citation needed] The Atacama Desert is rich in metallic mineral resources such as copper, gold, silver and iron, as well as nonmetallic minerals including important deposits of boron, lithium, sodium nitrate, and potassium salts. The Salar de Atacama is where bischofite is extracted.[citation needed] These resources are exploited by various mining companies such as Codelco, Lomas Bayas, Mantos Blancos, and Soquimich.[55][56] Because of its high altitude, nearly nonexistent cloud cover, dry air, and freedom from light pollution and radio interference from widely populated cities and towns, this desert is one of the best places in the world to conduct astronomical observations.[58][59] Hundreds of thousands of stars can be viewed via telescope since the desert experiences more than 200 cloudless nights each year. A number of telescopes have been installed to help astronomers from across the globe study the universe.[60] A radio astronomy telescope, called the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, built by European countries, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Chile in the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory officially opened on 3 October 2011.[61] A number of radio astronomy projects, such as the CBI, the ASTE and the ACT, among others, have been operating in the Chajnantor area since 1999. On 26 April 2010, the ESO council decided to build a fourth site, Cerro Armazones, to be home to the Extremely Large Telescope.[62][63][64] Construction work at the ELT site started in June 2014.[65] The European Southern Observatory operates three major observatories in the Atacama and is currently building a fourth: The Atacama Desert is popular with all-terrain sports enthusiasts. Various championships have taken place here, including the Lower Atacama Rally, Lower Chile Rally, Patagonia-Atacama Rally, and the latter Dakar Rally's editions. The rally was organized by the Amaury Sport Organisation and held in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The dunes of the desert are ideal rally races located in the outskirts of the city of Copiap\u00f3.[66] The 2013 Dakar 15-Day Rally started on 5 January in Lima, Peru, through Chile, Argentina and back to Chile finishing in Santiago.[67] Visitors also use the Atacama Desert sand dunes for sandboarding (Spanish: duna). A week-long foot race called the Atacama Crossing has the competitors cross the various landscapes of the Atacama.[68] An event called Volcano Marathon takes place near the Lascar volcano in the Atacama Desert.[69] Eighteen solar powered cars were displayed in front of the presidential palace (La Moneda) in Santiago in November 2012.[70] The cars were then raced 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) through the desert from 15\u201319 November 2012.[71] Most people who go to tour the sites in the desert stay in the town of San Pedro de Atacama.[72] The Atacama Desert is in the top three tourist locations in Chile. The specially commissioned ESO hotel is reserved for astronomers and scientists.[73] About 80 geysers occur in a valley about 80\u00a0km from the town of San Pedro de Atacama. They are closer to the town of Chiu Chiu.[74] The Ba\u00f1os de Puritama are rock pools which are 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the geysers.[75] Icy Penitentes by moonlight Tara Cathedrals (left) and Tara salt flat Valle de la Luna, near San Pedro de Atacama Laguna Verde Valley in Atacama Salt evaporation ponds in the Atacama Desert Desert bloom (desierto florido) Llamas Valley of Death Machuca chapel Paranal Observatory Chajnantor Plateau in the Chilean Andes, home to the ESO/NAOJ/NRAO ALMA The Milky Way streaking across the skies above the Chilean Atacama Desert Angel Locsin (born April\u00a023, 1985) is a Filipina actress and humanitarian.

She had her breakthrough as an avian-human hybrid in the fantasy series Mulawin (2004), before starring as Darna in the Ravelo Komiks Universe series Darna (2005). The role of a fledgling werewolf in the supernatural drama series Lobo (2008) earned her an International Emmy Award nomination for Best Actress. Locsin drew praise for the critically acclaimed dramas Love Me Again (2009), In the Name of Love (2011), and One More Try (2012). She won a Star Award for playing an indoctrinated military nurse in the spy action series The General's Daughter (2019). Locsin promotes various causes, including disaster relief, education, and women's rights. (This\u00a0article is part of a featured topic: Overview of Angel Locsin.) April 23: National Sovereignty and Children's Day in Turkey (1920) The Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar, Germany, houses a major collection of German literature and historical documents. In 1991, the tricentennial of its opening to the public, the Ducal Library was renamed for Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. Today, the library is a public research library for literature and art history and contains over 1,000,000 items, 150,000 of which are available for open use and borrowing. The main focus of the collection is German literature from the Classical and the late Romantic eras. The library was inscribed on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites as part of the Classical Weimar site because of its testimony to the global cultural importance of Weimar in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, during the Weimar Classicism movement.

Its population in 2010 was 5,336.[3][4][5] Barrios (which are roughly comparable to minor civil divisions)[13] in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanizaci\u00f3n to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others.[14][15][16] The following sectors are in Lomas barrio:[17][18] Parcelas Las Cuatrocientas, Sector Las Yayas, Sector Lomas Cole, Sector Los Casillas, Sector Los Fortis, Sector Los Gonz\u00e1lez, Sector Mart\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez, and Sector Quebrada Prieta.

Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit in good faith, and tens of millions already have! Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by containing information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, it consists of freely editable content, whose articles also have numerous links to guide readers to more information. Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers, anyone with Internet access (and who has not been blocked) can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting over a billion visitors monthly. It currently has more than sixty million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,647,007 articles in English with 127,336 active contributors in the past month. Wikipedia's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines, although editors do not need to be familiar with them before contributing. Anyone can edit Wikipedia's text, references, and images. What is written is more important than who writes it. The content must conform with Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable by published sources. Editors' opinions, beliefs, personal experiences, unreviewed research, libelous material, and copyright violations will not remain. Wikipedia's software allows easy reversal of errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits. Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. It is continually created and updated, and encyclopedic articles on new events appear within minutes rather than months or years. Because anyone can improve Wikipedia, it has become more comprehensive, clear, and balanced than any other encyclopedia. Its contributors improve the quality and quantity of the articles as well as remove misinformation, errors, and vandalism. Any reader can fix a mistake or add more information to articles (see Researching with Wikipedia).  Begin by simply clicking the [edit] or [edit\u00a0source]\u00a0buttons or the pencil icon\u00a0 at the top of any non-protected page or section. Wikipedia has tested the wisdom of the crowd since 2001 and found that it succeeds.  Introduction ReadersHow to report a problem with an article, or find out more information.

Discussions in the following areas have requested wider attention via Requests for comment:  You can usually move a page to a new title by clicking on the move tab at the top of the page.  This preserves the edit history by transferring the edit history along with the page move. The talk page, will be moved as well, if you check the box requesting that.  When a page is moved, a redirect is automatically created at the old location. Please fix any double redirects that result. Use the \"what links here\" link in the left hand column of any page to find the double redirects so you can edit them and point them to the new page name. Moving a page in this way is not possible in some cases, such as when a page other than a fresh redirect exists at the destination, or when the page is move protected, but you can ask for help at Wikipedia:Requested moves. Please do not \"cut and paste\" to move the text to its new location, because this leaves the page history behind. Thank you.  This is a list of recent changes to Wikipedia.

Sorry, in order to use this uploading script and to upload files, you need to be logged in with your named account. Please log in and then try again. Your account has not become confirmed yet. Sorry, in order to upload files on the English Wikipedia, you need to have a confirmed account. Normally, your account will become confirmed automatically once you have made 10 edits and four days have passed since you created it.      You may already be able to upload files on the Wikimedia Commons, but you can't do it on the English Wikipedia just yet. If the file you want to upload has a free license, please go to Commons and upload it there. Important note: if you don't want to wait until you are autoconfirmed, you may ask somebody else to upload a file for you at Wikipedia:Files for upload.  In very rare cases an administrator may make your account confirmed manually through a request at Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed.  Sorry, a few special characters and character combinations cannot be used in the filename for technical reasons. This goes especially for #\u00a0<\u00a0>\u00a0[\u00a0]\u00a0|\u00a0:\u00a0{\u00a0}\u00a0/\u00a0 and ~~~. Your filename has been modified to avoid these. Please check if it is okay now. The filename you chose seems to be very short, or overly generic. Please don't use: A file of this name already exists on Commons! If you upload your file with this name, you will be masking the existing file and make it inaccessible. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. This should not be done, except in very rare exceptional cases. Please don't upload your file under this name, unless you seriously know what you are doing. Choose a different name for your new file instead.  A file of this name already exists. If you upload your file with this name, you will be overwriting the existing file. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. Please don't do this, unless you have a good reason to: It is very important that you read through the following options and questions, and provide all required information truthfully and carefully. Thank you for offering to upload a free work. Wikipedia loves free files. However, we would love it even more if you uploaded them on our sister project, the Wikimedia Commons.Files uploaded on Commons can be used immediately here on Wikipedia as well as on all its sister projects. Uploading files on Commons works just the same as here. Your Wikipedia account will automatically work on Commons too.   Please consider uploading your file on Commons. However, if you prefer to do it here instead, you may go ahead with this form. You can also first use this form to collect the information about your file and then send it to Commons from here. Please note that by \"entirely self-made\" we really mean just that.  Do not use this section for any of the following: Editors who falsely declare such items as their \"own work\" will be blocked from editing. Use this only if there is an explicit licensing statement in the source.  The website must explicitly say that the image is released under a license that allows free re-use for any purpose, e.g. the Creative Commons Attribution license. You must be able to point exactly to where it says this. If the source website doesn't say so explicitly, please do not upload the file. Public Domain means that nobody owns any copyrights on this work. It does not mean simply that it is freely viewable somewhere on the web or that it has been widely used by others.  This is not for images you simply found somewhere on the web. Most images on the web are under copyright and belong to somebody, even if you believe the owner won't care about that copyright. If it is in the public domain, you must be able to point to an actual law that makes it so. If you can't point to such a law but merely found this image somewhere, then please do not upload it.  Please remember that you will need to demonstrate that: This file will be used in the following article: Enter the name of exactly one Wikipedia article, without the [[...]] brackets and without the \"http://en.wikipedia.org/...\" URL code. It has to be an actual article, not a talkpage, template, user page, etc. If you plan to use the file in more than one article, please name only one of them here. Then, after uploading, open the image description page for editing and add your separate explanations for each additional article manually.  Example \u2013 article okay.  This article doesn't exist! The article Example could not be found. Please check the spelling, and make sure you enter the name of an existing article in which you will include this file. If this is an article you are only planning to write, please write it first and upload the file afterwards.  This is not an actual encyclopedia article! The page Example is not in the main article namespace. Non-free files can only be used in mainspace article pages, not on a user page, talk page, template, etc. Please upload this file only if it is going to be used in an actual article. If this page is an article draft in your user space, we're sorry, but we must ask you to wait until the page is ready and has been moved into mainspace, and only upload the file after that.  This is a disambiguation page! The page Example is not a real article, but a disambiguation page pointing to a number of other pages. Please check and enter the exact title of the actual target article you meant. If neither of these two statements applies, then please do not upload this image. This section is not for images used merely to illustrate an article about a person or thing, showing what that person or thing look like. In view of this, please explain how the use of this file will be minimal. Well, we're very sorry, but if you're not sure about this file's copyright status, or if it doesn't fit into any of the groups above, then: Please don't upload it. Really, please don't. Even if you think it would make for a great addition to an article. We really take these copyright rules very seriously on Wikipedia. Note that media is assumed to be fully-copyrighted unless shown otherwise; the burden is on the uploader. In particular, please don't upload: If you are in any doubt, please ask some experienced editors for advice before uploading. People will be happy to assist you at Wikipedia:Media copyright questions. Thank you. This is the data that will be submitted to upload:  Your file is being uploaded.  This might take a minute or two, depending on the size of the file and the speed of your internet connection. Once uploading is completed, you will find your new file at this link: File:Example.jpg Your file has been uploaded successfully and can now be found here: File:Example.jpg Please follow the link and check that the image description page has all the information you meant to include. If you want to change the description, just go to the image page, click the \"edit\" tab at the top of the page and edit just as you would edit any other page. Do not go through this upload form again, unless you want to replace the actual file with a new version. To insert this file into an article, you may want to use code similar to the following: If you wish to make a link to the file in text, without actually showing the image, for instance when discussing the image on a talk page, you can use the following (mark the \":\" after the initial brackets!): See Wikipedia:Picture tutorial for more detailed help on how to insert and position images in pages.

In 1991, the tricentennial of its opening to the public, the Ducal Library was renamed for Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. Today, the library is a public research library for literature and art history and contains over 1,000,000 items, 150,000 of which are available for open use and borrowing. The main focus of the collection is German literature from the Classical and the late Romantic eras. The library was inscribed on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites as part of the Classical Weimar site because of its testimony to the global cultural importance of Weimar in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, during the Weimar Classicism movement.
